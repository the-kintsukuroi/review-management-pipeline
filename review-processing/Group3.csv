"very nice visit with family over the Halloween weekend. Clean . very responsive staff to all our needs , umbrellas when raining, car, breakfast. thank you to amalia vasquez and crisela amaor for their kind assistance during the breakfast meals, the room staff and front desk. also enjoyed Hojoko next door.",Real
"Crisela and Amalia were so very nice and very sweet. They had everything prepared and we're happy to take special requests, we are very pleased! The smoothies were excellent and they were happy to make them.",Real
"Pass by this place frequently and didn’t know it was a hotel. Such a cool vibe and experience, most importantly…affordable! Workers were very nice as well. Just wish there were better parking options…other than that i Will be coming back!",Real
"What FUN! The rooms are clean and somewhat large, the staff is nothing be wonderful and accommodating. They do whatever it takes to make you comfortable. Hats off to the breakfast attendants as well, especially Paula, Crisela and Amalia, nice, professional again doing whatever they can to please. Highly recommend especially if you like rock and roll!! In back of Fenway Park if you a sports fan.",Real
Neat boutique hotel for Boston music scene lovers and Boston Red Sox Fans! Record player in every room and a lovely all year round outdoor salt water pool. Complimentary Cold brew and hot coffee at front desk. Modern decor. Very hip and cool music memorabilia!,Real
"Great first time stay here at Verb!! Everything was great from check in to check out! We will definitely be back. The rooms were clean, comfortable and quiet. Breakfast had a great selection of hot and cold options and was excellent.",Real
"This is our second time staying here. Hotel is soo convenient to Fenway and Valet parking is a plus. Everyone here has been so friendly and the hotel has a really cool atmosphere. Not luxury but comfortable, clean and cool decor. The restaurant next door has a continental breakfast with a good selection and really lovely people working there. Crisela was so kind and helpful with my kids endless requests.",Real
"Great room, very clean, had everything I needed. Friendly, laid back atmosphere. Very relaxing. Nice continental breakfast with friendly servers. Right next to Fenway so it will be loud on game nights - bring earplugs if you’re not watching the game. Will stay again.",Real
"ROOM 109 was comfortable BUT at night the room was lit up like daylight. The curtain did not contain the lights by the pool, we had a very poor night sleep. The room was too expensive for the accommodations.",Real
"This review is specific to Amalia (breakfast attendant) and the other early AM staff at the Verb. Awesome service! Early flight in got me to the hotel many hours before check in, but the staff checked my bag for me and they had a great complimentary breakfast available right then and there. Amalia was wonderful, answering my questions with kindness you don't often see at 7am. Looking forward to the rest of my stay, and future visits.",Real
"This rock and roll themed hotel was great. Loved all the posters and other memorabilia. Every room has a turn table and there are tons of records you can get from the lobby to play. Beds were very comfortable. Breakfast was a cut above with excellent baked goods, hard boiled eggs,, fruit, yogurt and waffles - and all served with a smile. Only issue for us was it was a ways from most of our activities which were closer to Back Bay area and convention center.",Real
"This hotel is everything it advertised and more! The great music theme vibe, the amazing photo ops and the staff are all so friendly. Continental breakfast included :) Crisela the breakfast attendant was the best.",Real
"This was a college visit trip for us. The hotel is easy walking distance to BU and Northeastern (and many other universities for that matter). Things we loved about the hotel—the staff are really friendly and upbeat, the complementary beverages including nitro cold brew, wide array of breakfast offerings, clean and funky decor, clever rock n roll sayings ALL OVER THE PLACE, generous name brand toiletries in the room (I could’ve left so many liquids at home), Keurig vs the sachet, comfortable bedding and pillows, fun baseball crowd when the Red Sox are in town, walking distance to many attractions otherwise near the train. My teen daughter and I enjoyed our stay very much. I will return.",Real
"Our first visit and we were totally impressed! Perfect location with Fenway directly behind the hotel, and walking distance to plenty of food (Lorraine's) and nightlife (House of Blues). Can walk to BU and Northeastern campuses within 15 minutes. Love the vibrant rock 'n roll vibe and decor throughout! Each room has a vinyl turntable and a stock of some records but you can take/choose more from the hotel's extensive collection in the lobby. Breakfast is included and we had live guitar music during our weekend stay. Outdoor heated pool and variety of outside seating spots to sit with a morning coffee or around the pool. The front desk staff was AMAZING!! All of them! Kind, courteous, helpful outgoing and seem to really enjoy their job and the guests. A breath of fresh air to",Real
Crisela was so polite and helpful our breakfast was fresh service was great and quick The verb hotel is awesome and the staff attentive and helpful Everything was clean and delightful This is our second time here and we will be back again,Real
"My girlfriend and I embarked on a 5+ city east coast tour.The Verb Hotel was easily the most memorable of our lodging decisions. The place is charming and the hospitality was second to none. We thoroughly enjoyed exploring new music with the in room record player. Not to mention, it's next door to one of the most revered sporting venues in the world. The only regret was that it wasn't a little warmer during our trip, so that we could have enjoyed the pool. The Verb will be at the top of our list when we make a return trip to Boston.",Real
"Probably to cool for me, this property is boutique in every sense. Upon entering, we were warmly greeted by the front desk staff as each of them introduced themselves by name. We knew we were in a place unlike any other by the dark walls and rock and roll décor. After we checked in, we were shown the amp that was a refrigerator holding bottles of water for the guests and the vinyl record collection you could borrow from to use in your room which was equipped with a record player. The rooms were nice but I could have used a newer mattress. The hotel located right beside Fenway. We could literally see one of Fenway's walls from the small hotel pool. The pool was amazing! They keep it heated to what I would describe as bathwater temperatures. One of the nights that we were",Real
"My daughter and I (15) stayed here recently. Love!! The staff was great. Helpful. Fun. Kind. Genuinely interested in us and our travel. On site restaurant was amazing. A stranger even helped us with our bag. Back to the vibe... we pulled records from the lobby and played them in our room. Great musical theme and feel. I was a bit concerned about the party vibe but it was low-key and well, so fun. Great Energy! The tour buses were ADORABLE. We'd stay again in a hot minute. My teenager agrees.",Real
This is our second stay here and each time they have been professional and fun at the same time . Their music theme is a real plus and adds so much to the atmosphere. It’s appealing to a variety of age groups. The rooms are a good size and have all the amenities you could want including a turntable and speaker!,Real
"We booked a two-night stay and were impressed that the theme of the hotel is clear but not overbearing. Parking is a bit outrageous at $65/day. Understandably, parking is a luxury in Boston, but it would have been nice to have a slightly better rate, considering the price of the room was almost $250/night. Complimentary breakfast was surprisingly good - they had a nice spread of fruit, waffles, oatmeal, cereal, bagels, toast, smoothies, coffee/juice/tea, etc. Room was very clean, check in and check out were quick and easy. We would stay at this hotel again, but would recommend not bringing a car if you can avoid it. Ubers around the city are cheap, and many things are within walking distance.",Real
This is not our first time nor will it be our last! We have a son in college nearby the Verb. It is so convenient. An amazing boutique hotel that is always clean and friendly. The complimentary breakfast always is just enough. Tom at the front desk always goes above and beyond to be personable. Makes a huge difference! This was about our 8th time staying and We look forward to returning very soon.,Real
"Needed a last-minute room for the night when going to a Sox game and The Verb did not disappoint. Its location, literally feet from Fenway Park, is ideal. What’s not A deal is the cost— over $600/night + taxes + parking fee, but it was a busy Sox/Yankees weekend and I was in a bind. Too much $$ BUT the friendly staff and great room made up for it, and they very generously gave me a small discount and a late checkout 🙌 Really comfy king bed, huge TV w/lots of channels, huge bathroom and the cool rock ‘n roll paraphernalia give the rooms and the whole hotel a great vibe. Big kudos to the GM Paul and the front desk staff who really helped me (& my dog!) when I was in a rush, and even bigger kudos to the super-friendly and helpful valet staff, James & CISCO!! Thank you guys!",Real
"Our second time staying at the Verb while attending a Red Sox game. It couldn't be better. The location is perfect, the people at The Verb work hard to make your stay fun. And if you're a Rock n' Roll fan, it doesn't get any better!",Real
"We stayed here for a Red Sox game, the park is literally 100 feet from the hotel. If you like a little old school Rock and Roll with a Modern flare, this is the place for you. Rooms were clean and comfortable, and the Staff were very knowledgeable and friendly. Definitely 5 out of 5 ⭐️ For us.",Real
"Great location within walking distance to The House of Blues, which is why we stayed here at the Verb. We wanted a night out and a safe walk back. Awesome vibe, we played records and enjoyed people watching from our room looking into Fenway. Very clean, comfortable bed and pillows, and A.C. Friendly and accommodating staff. We used the valet to park our car overnight for a fee. Can’t wait to stay here again!",Real
"Fun decor really leans in to the rock-'n'-roll vibe. Found some really cool music to enjoy. The staff was young and responsive. Always a cheerful greeting when we would get back . Location is good, although most restaurants and bars close early.",Real
"The hotel is right next to Fenway Park. You can see their theme on their website. They have a few cool twists, such as LPs you can take to your room. Every room has a turntable. I stayed in the Rolling Stones room. Each room has a specific rock-star or rock-star-group imprint. The one thing I didn't like is the ""amenities"" fee, which covers access to the heated saltwater pool, the LPs and unlimited free water in the lobby mini fridge (which looks like a speaker). This wasn't divulged ahead of time. I didn't see it on their website. So what are you going to do at check in? Say no... and go look for another hotel? No, you pony up the $25 or whatever it is. Not the most transparent business practice. It's increasingly used by some hotels but if it's not clear before you",Real
"Stayed here with my daughter the week leading up to her dorm move-in day and we loved it. Because of the nature of it being a motor lodge setup (and the large quantity of college students that particular week), the hallways could get a little noisy at times, but it was generally brief. Hotel is cool and on trend, lots of fun rock memorabilia everywhere. LOVED having a record player in our room and made use of it (and the free bottled water and free Nitro-Brew in the lobby) daily. Very good sushi restaurant on site with live music. Walking distance form the Berklee/Boston Conservatory Campus (and I think Boston University.) Lots of shopping and dining choices extremely close by and, of course, Fenway stadium is right behind the hotel if you are in Boston for a game. Great staff,",Real
"Let's get the negative out of the way with first. Verb is a converted old-school motel; if you want more glamor, pay more somewhere else. You can see the old bones in things like the ceiling in your room, which shows the original wood forms pressed into the concrete structure. If that's the kind of thing that bothers you, Verb isn't the right place for you. But, if you don't mind that, Verb offers a whole lot. It's got a cool and funky vibe that isn't TOO cool and funky; my 18 year old liked it, and so did I. The rooms are clean, the mattresses are comfortable, and the bathrooms very nice. The people are friendly and helpful. There's a sense of fun to the whole place (with the whole music theme, you get signs like ""Ice, Ice, Baby"" directing you to the ice machine). The",Real
"Love the Verb hotel and the whole music theme. The record players in rooms and vinyl library are a delightful touch. Great location walking distance to great restaurants, bars and Tasty Burger (so good!!). Great for visiting college parents or baseball fans. (Seconds from Fenway.)",Real
"The Verb is, without a doubt, my favorite hotel in the city. My husband and I have stayed there a few times, and it’s always stellar: the rooms are fabulous, the location is amazing, and the staff is delightful from check in to check out. We had tickets to go to a concert at Fenway during our last stay (August 5), which happened to be the permanent roommate’s birthday. When I booked, I opted for the All You Need is Love package, but forgot to call the day before to set up a time for the chocolate and rosé to be set up. When we got back from the show, Tom (who I believe was the manager on duty) told me not to worry and showed up with the goods - the chocolate, the rosé, *and* a Beach Boys album that my husband and I bought on CD the weekend we got engaged. It was hospitality to",Real
"The Verb hotel was an amazing stay! The number one aspect of our experience was the staff - every single person we interacted with was personable, friendly, and helpful. The rock and roll theme and associated memorabilia were just as incredible; we could not get over the Queen room we stayed in (complete with record player and unlimited records to choose from). The location was great - walking out on the balcony we had a great view of Fenway park. Lots of great restaurants nearby! Would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Boston - fans and non-fans of rock n' roll alike! BOOK NOW",Real
"Pros: literally across from Fenway, a salt water pool, super friendly staff, unique hotel decor. Cons: even though the decor is unique the rooms offer average amenities, hotel bar closes early, expensive (stayed 8/24/21 and the room ended up being over $400, high end pricing even for Boston)",Real
"The location, musical theme, and breakfast were all solid! We were able to get a last minute ticket to a baseball game, had fantastic food near by, and the breakfast actually had protein options (not just a carb fest) -- wonderful value",Real
1st floor at door 123 the hall squeaks you know what I’m talking about…super cool friendly staff can’t beat the location…selection at breakfast was very good the smoothies are worth it…is the pool heated???,Real
"The Verb is amazing! I mean, Nitro coffee ON TAP in the lobby 24/7?! Yes please! Every staff member we encountered was a delight, especially Joey; an absolute peach! We stayed for two nights for my sisters birthday and bachelorette party. Continental breakfast was perfect for grabbing a quick bite. We stayed during “hurricane” Henri so we weren’t able to utilize the pool but we had a balcony room overlooking the pool so good enough. Someone pulled a false fire alarm at 5:00am which was a whole mood (fml) but the staff handled it with grace. We went out to several local bars and restaurants, Lolita was the BEST! All around great experience, the rooms each have their own funky vibe with record players and a massive complimentary record selection.. and did I mention the Nitro",Real
"1st impressions are everything! Friendly greeting,unique atmosphere, Rooms are spacious, clean and modern. Love the Bigelow products for shower & after shower. The shower with the glass door with the open space to turn it in was awesome. I would stay there again and recommend to others.",Real
"The crew at the Verb were great. Thanks to Aracely, Amalia Vasquez, Cisco, Joey Jordan, Tom, and I’m sorry I can’t remember the rest of your names. You made the stay easy and pleasant. Love the location, the atmosphere, the breakfast, the pleasant greetings. Rock on!",Real
We loved the rooms and the atmosphere. The staff was excellent-friendly and so kind. Loved the cold brew! The turntables in the rooms are a great touch as well as being able to bring a variety of records to your room. Blanca left outer room near and tidy!,Real
I have stayed at the Verb several times with some friends it has always been a great experience. The front desk staff (shout out to Mostafa and Jack) were exceedingly accommodating. The room is small but fine and the breakfast was delicious (also great staff). The smoothie was awesome! We look forward to our next stay.,Real
"My family and I spent two great evenings as guests at The Verb and feel like we left as family. What a great little hotel gem. Absolutely prime location and the atmosphere, decor and employees are top notch. Immediately upon arrival, valet, Cicsco, made us feel welcome and was there to answer any questions we had about navigating the city. Hope to return here again. If music is your thing this hotel is a must! Also, it's right next to Fenway Park.",Real
We booked this hotel last minute while visiting Boston for a Red Sox game. I was a little apprehensive because we were traveling with little kids and this is a “rock n roll” hotel. I was very wrong! The staff was accommodating and kind. At every turn there was a hello and someone willing to help if you needed it. The rooms were clean and comfortable! Amazing stay!,Real
"I cannot say enough great things about The Verb. From the moment we checked in, the staff made us feel like VIP rock stars! Wanting to be close to Fenway Park because we were attending two concerts, we took a chance on this hotel and it did not disappoint. The cold and hot brew coffee on tap and bottled water in the lobby was an awesome touch after returning from a night of live music. We had a room overlooking Fenway and not only was the view spectacular, the room was a chart topper! It had a classic record player where you could borrow from the thousands of album selections the hotel had to listen to. The puns on the amenities added that extra special touch. They did not miss a beat when it came to the little things. The only disappointment was that we didn't stay longer",Real
"Absolutely loved our stay. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Our kids loved the heated outdoor pool, they are still talking about it. We got a free short live concert from Guns'N Roses. They did a soundcheck at Fenway for their next day concert. Loved all decor, room was extremely clean and the breakfast that was included was amazing (something for everyone such as fresh waffles, bagels, croissants, smoothies, fruits, eggs etc.). The two breakfast ladies were amazing! Will definitely stay there again!",Real
"The Verb is a unique hotel and if you are a fan of supporting small businesses and shopping local then you definitely want to consider staying with them. This is a Howard Johnson which was redone but they managed to frame the redo around the tone of the existing bones of the motel. If you are a music fan then this is an absolutely joy of an experience. Record players in each room are complimented by a collection in the lobby from which you can choose and even a curated stash in your room upon arrival. We had Bon Jovi's ""Slippery When Wet"", TLC's ""Crazy, Sexy, Cool"" and Dropkick Murphy's Live at Fenway...perfection as far as my family was concerned. Room was clean and layout is general. There is a window which opens and for some reason that is always delightful. We had a view of",Real
"Sisco was a great staff member working at The Verb . He greeted us with a huge smile, welcomed us back, and asked why we were staying….of course for the Fenway concert! Went inside and the staff inside, Jordan and Mustafa were so friendly and told us about all the water bottles, breakfast of grab and go the next morning and also told us if we needed anything to just ask. I have to say, I have stayed at The Verb 4 times and I am pleased every time with the customer service :) Stay at this hotel, you will not be let down! Thank you all so much! Till next time :)",Real
"We rented two rooms to stay in after a concert at Fenway. The hotel was great and really added to our experience! The decor was interesting to look through, all of the staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful. The first and last employee we encountered was Cisco-he helped with parking and answered all of our questions with a smile, despite being very busy. We definitely would return for another show!",Real
"We visited Boston for 2 days to go the Green Day/Weezer concert at Fenway. I booked the VERB thinking it looked pretty cool from their website, but honestly the website doesn't do it justice. The theming is on point, the staff is amazing and the restaurant attached is an absolute must! Everything from the fantastic breakfast to the vinyl were above and beyond. Can't say enough about our stay other than that we can't wait to come back. It's very kid friendly as well. Pro tip: get a fenway facing room. We got a free Billy Joel concert from our window the night before Green Day/Weezer!",Real
"I recently won a contest that The Verb had and was excited to finally stay at this unique boutique hotel. I've been wanting to visit since I first discovered them on Instagram last year. Winning this contest finally gave me the opportunity. From the moment I walked into the lobby I was greeted by friendly, upbeat staff who were genuinely happy to check me in. I've been to hotels where the staff are just going through the motions. Not here. From the front desk to the valet to the girls serving breakfast, it is obvious that the staff at The Verb love their jobs. We had the Deluxe Aerosmith suite and it was decorated with all sorts of cool memorabilia, a record player connected to a small marshall speaker and a balcony view of Fenway Park. We could choose from a large",Real
I had a sisters vacation at the verb and we are already wanting to go back! The vibe is chill and the staff is so accommodating and welcoming. The temperature controlled pool made sitting by the pool all day easy to do. The hotel is centrally located to restaurants and bars. The rooms and balconies are spacious making it a perfect spot to relax!,Real
"It was everything I had hoped for in booking my 1st Trip to Boston !! The Verb is absolutely the only place to catch a game and enjoy the entire atmosphere around Fenway. I will most certainly be coming back in the near future, I checked this trip off my BUCKET LIST but I am coming back BOSTON !!",Real
Our 1st visit will not be our last! The vintage atmosphere was refreshing. Thoroughly enjoyed the heated saltwater pool. Loved the vinyl record collection we could play in our rooms. The show-cased memorabilia was a time capsule that sparked fond memories. Even the 1947 Greyhound-converted camper was a thrill of its own. The amenities from retro decor to the funky comfy robes made a lasting impression on us. But what really topped our charts was the fantastic friendly staff. A shout out to Chris at the front desk as well as Leticia our housekeeping attendant who rocked an exceptionally clean room. We look forward to our next stay at the Verb. Carolyn & Steven Bueno,Real
"This place rocks, literally. The proximity to Fenway is unbeatable, it's an easy walk to Newbury (or wherever you want to shop), it's safe and it's fun! The free breakfast was more than enough...and you can eat poolside.",Real
"Hotel is in a fantastic location in the Fenway neighborhood of Boston, right next to Fenway Park. Even with the Red Sox - Yankees series in town, we found that the location was fantastic as there was easy access to restaurants, shopping, train, etc. They allow families but just feels like a better fit for a couple.",Real
"Super cool place, nice room and shower, clean and convenient. Very friendly staff that was a pleasure to chat with. Enjoyed the music and pool. Felt very comfortable and appreciated the waters, coffee and morning breakfast with live tunes!!",Real
"We LOVED our stay at the Verb Hotel! It is located just behind Fenway Park, and we chose it specifically for this reason. BUT, it did not disappoint in any other category! We loved the staff--all of them. They were all very friendly and accommodating. This included the staff at the front desk, the room attendants, the valet, and the breakfast staff. EVERYONE was amazing! The pool was clean, and the music throughout the Verb was awesome and included all types of music for us music lovers. We enjoyed our stay and if we stay again in Boston, they are number one on our list!! Thank you Verb!!",Real
Absolutely loved our stay at The Verb. The hotel itself was adorable -- loved the decor and the music theme. The fact that you could take classic records back to your room and play them on your own record player located in the room was so fun!! The pool was insanely cool and the on-site restaurant one of the best meals I had on my vacation. Complimentary breakfast was generous. Location was decent -- the only way to get any closer to Fenway Park would be inside the stadium itself. Use the app Parking Whiz to access cheaper parking. We found safe 24 hour parking within a 5 minute walk from the hotel for $25.,Real
Awesome stay awesome theme everything was amazing the pool was awesome the employees were so friendly and hospitable such a cool experience and great selection of music very quiet and comfortable sleep and tasty breakfast,Real
"What a wonderful hotel! We love the personal attention and care. Such a special place and we can not wait to get back to Boston, also telling everyone about it! Thanks again for such a meaningful trip !",Real
"I had an amazing time on my staycation at The Verb. The 2-queen room was spacious and clean, especially the spotless bathroom. I love the overall design scheme of ‘70’s punk/rock & roll subculture. The record players in every room with the library of records in the lobby to choose from was a genius touch. The pool area was great, my meal at Hojoko was excellent and the complimentary breakfast was the best setup I’ve seen since covid- very smart setup. At the front desk, Olivia was wonderful- she recognized on the phone that I was a local on a staycation and went way out of her way to make sure I had a good time during my stay, from an early check-in to ensure I had some extra pool time, to a complimentary room upgrade, she really went the extra mile, while offering good advice",Real
Wonderful location. The staff are professional and super helpful. Very fun place for families. Nia Jack and Olivia were fantastic and made our stay so fun. They welcomed us when we came in at 1AM with clapping and great big smiles . We felt very welcome and it kicked off a great two night stay.,Real
"We loved staying here for 4 nights while visiting our son who lives in the area. It was our first hotel stay since COVID started. This hotel is like walking through a Rock and Roll museum! The breakfast was FABULOUS also. Staff were all so friendly. Safe and walkable area. The beds were super comfortable and the hotel was surprisingly quiet at night (and we are super picky about that). Loved playing some vinyl LPs in the room too. Also fun having my picture taken right underneath Mick on that yellow couch in the lobby! Highly recommend this hotel. The only surpise was the $25 fee per night, but that's because I didn't read the fine print when booking online. Rock and Roll, Hoochie Coo, right on!",Real
"Loved our stay! Awesome place and attention to detail! The breakfast was awesome, the rooms fabulous and all the amenities. The staff was so lovely and helpful- we ate at the restaurant on property and it was delish. We can not wait to come back!",Real
We stayed 6/29-7/1 and had a great experience. You will not find a better staff. Everyone was so welcoming and fun to be around. It’s right next to Fenway park. Aracely cleaned our room and did a phenomenal job! We will stay again.,Real
"We just returned from a four night stay and cannot recommend the place enough! From check in (and out) with Jordan, the stay started out excellent and stayed that way the entire visit. From the amazing music vibe and memorabilia, the the very retro and fun rooms (including your own record player, with access to a huge library of loaner records, a vintage typewriter and a clutch fan for those of you that are used to blasting your ceiling fan at night! The location was great if you are going to a Sox game! We had a room that had a view of Fenway, and actually opened our window one night and listened to part of the game while we watched in on our in room flat screen TV with the sound muted. The rooms were very clean, so a shout out to Karen who took care of ours! The game we did",Real
We had a amazing time staying here for a Red Sox game. The musical theme was on point. The record players and LPs in the room were such an awesome touch and the free nitro coffee in the lobby was also a big hit!! We will be staying here whenever we’re in Boston. Super fun and super friendly!,Real
"Visiting Boston with our teenage son. We all loved this place. Music/rock vibe is fun, pool lovely on a sunny day, great location next to Fenway, not far from the Charles, and 3 blocks to Fen park with paths, a track, b-ball hoops, and a beautiful rose garden. Breakfast was amazing and Amalia prepped waffles, bagels, and smoothies with a smile! Employees all seemed happy. Thomas at checkin also was positive and always helpful. Really enjoyed dinner at Hojoko too- great cocktails and interesting food. Was worried slightly about party atmosphere at pool but it was always shut down right at 10 to ensure all guests can have a good sleep.",Real

Breakfast at The Verb,R
"Fun, funky and fantastic staff",R
Our two boys (5 and 7) absolutely love this place. It’s our second visit and just as good as the first. Amalia and Paula took great care of us at breakfast (magical breakfast feast of all the things banned at home with some healthy stuff to placate the parents) and the vinyl selection is so fun. Now we’re off to jump in the pool again - in November - in Massachusetts…,R
"As always, a wonderful, vinyl spinning stay in the Fenway, at The Verb Hotel. Come for the funky atmosphere & vinyl, stay for the wonderful staff & Hojoko restaurant. Crisela will make you feel welcome at Breakfast and Audrey takes care of everything else!",R
"This hotel is beautiful, service is amazing. Ryan is one of the best workers here. We loved him! so friendly and all around cool guy. Also shout out to Chris too. Thank you Verb for the lovely experience, will be back soon xx",R
Staff was warm and exciting the minute we stepped in. The ambiance was as cool as it gets. It’s like you step into a time warp that somehow includes the 50s through today. Staff and room cleaning was more than accommodating. Super fun location right by Fenway and only a short Uber to and from popular spots. Couldn’t recommend this place enough.,R
"What an amazing, funky place to stay! We loved our experience at the Verb Hotel in Boston. ALL of the staff was super friendly, knowledge and cared about our trip and our experiences while we were in Boston. We loved the vinyl library and having our very own record player in our room! We were in town for a show at the House of Blues, easy walk from the Hotel and plenty of places to grab yummy food nearby. We'll be back for sure!",R
Our stay was absolutely wonderful! We loved this hotel! Everyone was so nice we especially liked Cisco and Mustafa! They were so accommodating and gave good advice which helped since we had never been to Boston. We would definitely stay here again!,R
"very unique hotel and a plus for the kids because there’s an outside heated pool. It was heated to I think close to 90° or maybe 100 which was needed especially if you’re visiting this hotel in the month of February. Not a fan of the breakfast at the diner attached to the hotel but the hotel is located in Fenway so many options for you to choose from. The front desk was very patient, friendly, and helpful. I had such a great time that I booked for another two nights in a month of April with my husband.",R
"The hotel was so fun and had such a great vibe. It was decorated retro music complete with a record player in your room and records in the lobby available for you to listen to in your room. The room was well equipped and had clever touches throughout. In fact, the whole hotel had unexpected, original design from signage to your hotel key to the exterior. The service was even better! Our flight was delayed, and they were very accommodating. Every person we dealt with was friendly, knowledgable, and eager to help with anything we needed. Great location too!",R
"Amalia and her team made our morning so much better! They were all so friendly, helpful and kind, not to mention the breakfast was delicious!! We will be back just for that alone. They took great care of us!",R
"We were in town for appointments at Boston Children’s. I’ve always wanted to try out this hotel. Wish I’d been picking this one every time! Clean, excellent staff, good quality quick breakfast, relaxing in our room with great records to play on the record player was just unique and fun… especially with my young adult son.",R
"I was taking my high school senior daughter on a college tour to schools in Boston when I accidentally discovered this gem. I’ve been to many hotels. I’ve almost never written a review, but what an amazing, novel experience this was! In addition to an incredibly friendly staff, the rock n roll vibe and decor is everywhere. Love the record players in every room AND the hundreds of vinyl albums to choose from in the lobby. And electric guitars we could jam on near the front desk? Wow! One of the coolest, best value places one could find anywhere in the country.",R
The complementary breakfast at the Verb is delicious and the attendants are great! (Thanks Crisela Amador.)I had a waffle and a muffin and they both were wonderful. What a fantastic start to a east coast road trip.,R
crislea was very helpful with serving us breakfast and helping us and offering us anything we needed. I got a choclate crossiant and it was really good. i also got a bowl of cereal. It was all very good.,R
Brooked The Verb for a 1 night stay to take my 9yo son to his first game at Fenway. Staff was awesome and the location was perfect. Should have made it a longer stay in Boston but I already had my son miss two days of school for this trip. Absolutely will stay again when I take the rest of the family to Boston. Plenty of food choices near the hotel and in the hotel. My son also learned what a typewriter and record player was thanks to both being in the room. He was amazed at the typewriter.,R
"Great stay! Was there for a medical need and staff was super accommodating. In particular a front desk staff went out to the local CVS to buy me some medicine I didn’t have. And they brought my dinner up to my room from the downstairs ramen restaurant. The breakfast staff, Paula and Kristala were super great too! 10/10 would stay again.",R
This was such a great little eclectic hotel... everyone was so friendly and helpful - the evening manager (sorry I forgot his name) to Saulo and Blanca who were both helpful and kept my room clean. My room had a record player - and you could pick your choice of oldies but goodies and bring them to your room... Will definitely return...,R
"An exciting hotel to tease your visual and audible senses! The decor, the music, and the vibe was more than we expected. And not to forget the complimentary breakfast! Chisela and her staff made every accommodation so that we enjoyed every bite. Highly recommend the Verb, it was perfect from start to finish! The Lindsay’s from VA",R
"My friend and I attended a concert at Fenway and stayed at The Verb Hotel afterwards. The location was great and convenient, the staff was very friendly and nice, the room was clean, and the ambiance was amazing",R
"Not only was the location great, but the hotel itself is awesome. Staff was very friendly and rooms were very clean. They even had a record player in every room-totally worth the price!!! If you’re looking for a hotel to stay at for a Fenway event, look no further!",R
This place was awesome. It is a must stay place for music lovers. The staff was friendly and the hotel was very clean and located within walking distance of many of our needs. We will definitely be back!,R
"This place was better than I expected. Perfect location and within walking distance of restaurants, souvenir stores, and Fenway Park. The zebra robes were a hit with my husband! Super friendly and helpful staff.",R
"The Verb Hotel is such a fun, retro environment! Very friendly staff, including Crisela Amador who served a delicious breakfast, offer a welcoming vibe. Highly recommend a stay at the Verb, especially if you need a quick walk to Fenway Park!",R
Truly the coolest and cleanest hotel we have ever stayed in. So neat and different. The staff is INCREDIBLE. Everyone is so kind and really helpful. Chris the valet was fantastic and always had our car ready quickly. 10/10 recommend staying here if you get the chance. Best hotel experience in Boston.,R
"hi, i’m korean. i can’t speak english very well. this hotel giving for us very nice night. so If I come to Boston again, I will come to this hotel. Especially the curly-haired male staff, thank you for being so kind to me.",R
"Our stay was awesome! We stayed at the Verb so we could be with in walking distance of Fenway! The room was clean, we had free breakfast, free coffee, and even had a couple discounts for local restaurants when you showed them your room key! Overall we had a great time and would definitely stay at the Verb again!",R
"This hotel is the full rock ‘n’ roll experience, from the mid century modern meets rock ‘n’ roll lobby to the clean lines minimalist modern room decor, our stay was top notch. There were some really cool little details like free 24 cold brew in the lobby, to the bottle of champagne delivered to my room because it was my birthday, to the zebra rock ‘n’ roll robes, and the most unique thing was the in-room record player and the huge library of vinyl that you could choose from to bring up to your room The location also cannot be beat, a few minutes walk to the green line train and Fenway Park was right out my window! So very cool!",R
Cool place. Great location. Clean and comfortable. Friendly staff. Lots of great music memorabilia. Pool looked nice but we didn’t use it. Valet parking and amenities fee is going to run you an additional $100 bucks per night. Just an FYI.,R
Where do I even begin? This place is like a rock stars dream come true! And if you are dreaming of the Rockstar life then look no further! From playable guitars in the lobby to a heated salt water pool! You feel like you just went backstage after your own show! There are even record players in each room and a FULL ASS SELECTION of LPS to choose from if you feel the need to rock out in your room! Or you can stroll the halls and check out all the memorabilia that they change out to keep it fresh or read the names of all the famous peeps that have stayed here that Aretha Franklin is singing out Witten on the wall near the lobby. I'm writing this out right now sitting out front while there is a band playing in fenway that I can hear is clear as if I'm in the venue. This isn't my,R
"This rock and roll themed hotel is right behind Fenway Park - it took us 2 minutes to walk there. Easy valet parking and in minutes we were sitting on our balcony listening to the tunes of Stevie Wonder as we had a pre-game cocktail. Upon check in, they upgraded us to a deluxe themed room! We stayed in the Led Zeppelin room, which had authentic memorabilia from the band covering the walls. There are record players in each room with a collection of albums in each room, but there is also a large assortment of albums from which to choose from in the lobby. The atmosphere in this place is awesome - trendy, hip and fun. The lobby has nitro cold brew and hot coffee on tap and unlimited water bottles available to guests. We didn't know this upon arrival, but it is a dog friendly hotel!",R
"Every employee, every visitor all were so nice! Check in and out were easy, valet parking was great. Record player and records in the rooms were so fun, and the pool was heavenly. The walk around the building to be at the Red Sox game couldn’t have been easier! Can’t wait to go back!",R
"Great location. Not sure how noise levels would be if there was a baseball game going on as we were literally a stones throw from the back of Fenway park. Consider carefully if you are going to have a car because they charge $65 a night to park your car there. We were fortunate in that we found a garage across the street in the new condo building that was allowing non-condo owners to park there for hourly fees, and ended up spending a total of $55 over 48 hours, even though we came and went multiple times. This was in late August 2021, but that situation may change. If you’re just walking and Ubering around, I definitely recommend this place. It was special— the music-themed touches were really fun. The staff and service were very good.",R
"We stayed at The Verb for a Sox game so we didn’t have a late/long drive home and my only regret is that our stay wasn’t longer. I was worried about having our five year old twins but once we checked in, I realized it was more family friendly than I anticipated. The rooms were so clean and they’d even left a Disney vinyl on the record player in our room; no detail spared. We took a quick dip in the pool to cool off before the game and it was great. No complaints!",R
"My first time at the Verb! Not only is the vibe fun with a real record player in your room, the staff was over the top nice and accommodating. I’ll be staying here when I return to Boston! Also don’t miss out on the coffee in the lobby. So good.",R
"We loved our stay for many reasons. First, close to Fenway for a Sox game, best and most festive breakfast around with amazing live music, great employees from the front desk/Producers to the breakfast crew! We would stay there again in a heart beat!",R
"Groovy, clean (there is always someone cleaning somewhere - and it smells wonderful), cool as s%#+, fun, friendly staff. Definitely choose from the 1500 vinyl options for your in-room turntable. We were there for 3 consecutive nights of games at Fenway - it’s busy, but great to be in the middle of it! Expensive overnight parking - choose the garage around the corner.",R
Fun boutique hotel with outdoor pool and view of Fenway. Staff could not be friendlier. Breakfast buffet was excellent with lots of variety. Smaller rooms but well designed. Love a hotel who thinks of an extra blanket. Also best robes ever in a zebra print with Verb logo. Complimentary coffee and water. If you love Rock and have a great sense of humor this hotel is for you. Pet friendly as well.,R
"Our one night stay for a Red Sox game turned into a mini vacation. The Sox lost but we won, with a great stay. All the staff were fantastic and the complimentary breakfast was way beyond average. I highly recommend this place and will be back for future games",R
"This used to be the old Howard Johnsons. IT is such a fun hotel. Unique atmosphere/retro and colorful decor, very friendly staff, had fun playing assorted records on the turntable. Unlimited water bottles and cold nitro brew coffee on tap 24/7. The room is very clean, bed is very comfy (thank you BLANCA!). Hojoko, the next door Japanese restaurants, is excellent for its food and jelly sake. There are also lots of restaurants around within walking distance. The parking is a bit steep at $65/day, but it beats running to meters all day or trying to find a parking spot without being stressed out. Also, it is right next to Fenway Stadium. The valet people are incredibly nice and will run out to get your car in no time. The continental breakfast is excellent with plenty of delicious",R
"We had such a great time at The Verb! If you are sick of every hotel looking and feeling the same, it’s time to try a boutique hotel, and if you are in Boston you have to stay at The Verb. It’s right next to Fenway Park, so it would be a great way to stay over if you’re at a game that runs late. The Rock ‘n Roll theme is fantastic, and the friendly staff carry it off well. Joey, who checked us in was super friendly and welcoming, and Cisco, the valet, was really cool. We drove up into the wrong driveway, but he took care of us anyway. He also showed us around the vintage Flxible bus in the Verb parking lot --amazing! Cisco is a nice guy, and he has a great playlist.* We enjoyed the pool, but most of all the general vibe, even just getting the hotel key (er, I mean",R
"I stayed with my family for 3 nights and was very impressed with Saulo and his team, what a great job they did! The room was very clean and the housekeepers was very pleasant. My daughter loved the turn table in the room. Plaining on returning soon.",R
We came for my son’s 11th birthday to go to a game at Fenway. It was a perfect weekend! Chris Sale pitched for the first time since his surgery and we loved the hotel! So much fun. The kids loved the pool and the records! Mom loved the Nitro on tap 24/7. The breakfast was great and the rooms were clean. I plan to come back and stay for Boston Calling in 2022.,R

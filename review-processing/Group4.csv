We have been Hyatt vacation club owners for nearly 20 years. With the pandemic and lockdowns weï¿½ve not used them for the last 2 years( very understandable). Unlike U.K. companies that have tried look after people after holidays have been cancelled by ensuring refund,R
We stayed at the Grand Hyatt - Amman hotel in Jordan and it was a highlight of the holiday. Nice to relax after a hot dusty day at the spa and two pools. Everything was empty due to covid 19  which added to the luxury and feeling of space.  Staff were excellent. ,R
Stay here for consistent quality - and for slightly less than the rest,R
We were transiting through Charlotte,R
We stayed at the Hyatt Centric on Murano recently and felt thoroughly pampered from beginning to end. Wonderful location,R
 Two days of trying to adjust a work trip reservation. multiple phone calls with over then 40 min waits and nothing resolved. I will never use Hyatt for any personal trips in the future. Just insane that you cant change a reservation with online chat. Best advise is to stay somewhere else then have to deal with Hyatts lack luster of customer service ,R
No hotel room is big and the Buffay but I do not like the color of the pool and the smell of it,R

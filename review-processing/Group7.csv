"Beware of HIDDEN FEES! I stayed 2 nights in the past October, and paid beforehand. 2 weeks later, I noticed my credit card was charged an extra $68.87. They explained it was a mandatory facility fee, $30 a night, plus tax. But it was NOT highlighted at their website at all. If it's mandatory, it should have been included when I paid for the booking. The room was fine. Not terrible, but definitely old. I stayed at a room with Times Square view on the 44th floor. The windows look like they haven't been cleaned for years. Shower water pressure was so strong it hurt a little, and no matter how you close the curtain, the dry area always flood a little afterwards. Don't pay close attention to the furnitures, carpet, wall corners, there are stains and cracks and god knows what.",F

"HORRIBLE SERVICE: I am trying to reach the corporate office to file a complaint about our AWFUL experience. We are staying at the millennium hotel in New York and the service desk representatives were very rude. I called the front desk to extend my stay past the 2pm checkout. I asked for the price and it was higher than the previous night and they said we had to change rooms. I kindly asked if I could speak to the manager, and the rep said �What do you need to speak to a manager for? They can�t help you with any.� I responded can I please talk to one and the representative hung up on me. We went downstairs to talk to the manager and he did nothing to solve our issue. Besides the bad customer service, there are stains on the sheets and brown circles in the bathtub. The pictures online are VERY deceiving. Facebook will only let me upload that one picture. We were only trying to extend because we had to drive to New York from Maryland because of an emergency. I wish zero stars was an option!",F

"The Millennium Broadway Hotel is in a great location. Close to restaurants and Broadway shows. A short walk away. Our doorman, LeFon went way above and beyond the call of duty to ensure our comfort and safety. Thank you for your hospitality!",R

"Buyer beware!!! Do not believe the stars. We booked two rooms: one room with 2 double beds and one with one queen bed. The rooms and hallways are tired, worn and dirty (so much staining on the carpets). I could clorox every surface but had to stop at the walls! It's dark and dingy inside. The bathroom had mold and mildew as well as old caulking. One of our double beds had stained sheets. The bedding left something to be desired.....flat pillows and an old ""quilt"" that looked more like a mattress pad. Thankfully the front desk staff was nice and let us out of our four night stay after just one night! I believe the reason this property still has so many stars is because it was a former Hilton property, but maintenance clearly stopped once Hilton dropped it. I do not recommend!",R

The view it�s awesome and the cleaning at the room hotel it�s excellent.The customer service it�s excellent and the security in hotel it�s very good. The only concert it�s they don�t have any parking.,F

terrible service - no one answering phone at front desk to stop noisy neighbor in the mid of night. picture looks deceiving. dated room. bathroom ceiling and floor leaking stains. I stayed there last night. I pick millennium times square for its location and good price. But it turned out to be a nightmare because no front desk response to call to stop noise from next door.,R

"I needed a staycation and chose the Four Seasons for a long weekend.  It was truly a beautiful experience.  Nothing pretentious about this place!  The bed in the room was the most comfortable I have felt outside of my own home.  I dined in my room for most meals,  the food and presentation was amazing.  Highly recommend the rueben, the lobster Mac and cheese and tuna tartare.  I cannot stress enough how happy and comfortable the staff made me feel  everyday.  Such genuine concern for my well-being, the staff ensured that all of my needs were met.  Stephen and Brian at the front door we so nice to talk to and very helpful.  I looked forward to seeing them during my stay.  True gentleman. ",Real
Just spent 4 nights at the FS Boston. Our stay was wonderful. The hotel was lovely and in a great location. An easy walk to restaurants and to the subway. The hotel also sits across from Boston Common park which was great to walk around. The service at this property was fantastic. Everyone from the front desk for check in to the doormen and the young men at the morning coffee shop. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Four Seasons is known for their service and this hotel was not a disappointment. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. I would definitely recommend a stay here...you won't be disappointed.,Real
"We have stayed at this Four Seasons many times ( and I have reviewed it before.) We love the calm, luxury vibe, the bright well taken care of rooms with oversize windows (love the park facing rooms,) the friendly staff, the indoor pool area which provides a nice place to relax, and the location. The Sanctuary ( an outdoor public space added during Covid ) is a great addition. However the former restaurant, Bristol, where we ate breakfast has now been closed for a year an a half and at this point for the prices the hotel is charging I really feel is no longer acceptable. On recent visits we overlooked it because we like the hotel so much and just went to grab breakfast at nearby places on Newbury and Boylston,but this past weekend Boston was packed.",Real
"If you want the perfect place to stay for Boston Marathon, look no further.  The Four Seasons is the best!  The service is impeccable.  The location is superb, especially if you are running the marathon. Everything was wonderful.  I look forward to returning in April 2022. ",Real
"Excellent hotel located conveniently across the street from Boston Public Garden. Easy walk to shopping, Boston Common, Newbury Street. Great service, though I can say after staying at this Four Seasons, The Mandarin & the Ritz Carlton (all in Boston) all within a few weeks of each other that staff is more sparse than normal. We loved having a nightcap in the bar. Parking is tricky as Boylston St is one way so watch the signs!",Real
"The staff was courteous and kind. Davis the concierge was helpful,kind,courteous, and gave great directions. The room was extremely COVID clean.Parking was great and reasonable.Had a refrigerator,microwave, and quite.",Real
"We stayed at The Inn At Longwood when we had medical appointment in Boston.  Our room was clean and comfortable.  It was right by the elevator but we did not hear any hall noise.  We ate at the food court  as we did not want a larger meal but they offer a restaurant that we have enjoyed in the past.  Check-in was easy.  The front desk is very friendly.    David, the concierge, asked if my husband  needed help with our bags as we had medical equipment with us.  He also delivered a wheel chair to our room.  He was very friendly and wished us well.",Real
"My wife and I came to the Inn at Longwood for a medical proceed at BIDMC, which is right across the street. Angel took care of us at the desk, but David the concierge took care of our bags and brought them to our room. He gave us a quick insight to the area. Clean safe rooms. Can you believe they leave rooms empty for 48hrs prior to booking them again.",Real
"Special shout out to “David - The Concierge” who could not have taken better care of me post race!  Thank You David, I’ll be back!  I had to fly out same day of race and while I couldn’t get a late check-out, I did get to shower at a local gym and David grabbed my checked bags several times.",Real
"I had 2 days of medical appointments during a heat wave.  Air conditioning was thankfully robust and our room was quite clean.  Parking and food is close by, along with a drugstore.  Food offerings won’t make the Michelin guide , but are adequate.  And if you don’t mind a good walk, Fenway Park is just down Brookline Ave.  Just head for the iconic and comforting Citgo sign.    Also , a quick shout out to Angel, the highly efficient front office mgr. who will go the extra mile to make sure your visit is pleasant!",Real
Overall this was a very blessed and stay. The hotel was clean and very convenient to the airport. Gabriella at the front desk was super helpful. I would stay here again if I I am in Boston. I would recommend this hotel,Real
$200 a night hotel in Boston Harbor… and then they charge you another $36 a day to park in their lot.  As paying guest… you have to pay more for the “luxury” of parking on site? Tacky.  And certainly not worth the extra money—nor is the hotel worth $200.,Real
"Very easy check in, beautiful views and very comfortable beds. staff was very helpful, the room and bathroom were very clean. The food was also very good. The men working the shuttles were so helpful and nice. Overall experience was wonderful.  If we come back to Boston, this will be the hotel we stay at. ",Real
"Rooms were spotless, beds very comfortable, the view of the bay outstanding. Just a perfect stay. Loved it!  Would not hesitate to book it again. Restaurant has a stunning view and quite good food, nice breakfast.     ",Real
Nice room overlooking Exeter street.  Parking garage across the street.  Central location with nice staff.  Easy walking distance to restaurants and the subway.  Temperature was either very hot or very cold in our room.  Not a pleasant experience.  We called desk.  They sent an engineer.  He opened the window and said he was going to check downstairs.  We woke up in the morning to 58 degrees.  We had already shut the window.  Called desk again.  He said he would go check the heat downstairs.  This is not a cheap motel.  Strange climate control situation.,Real
"I stayed here in 2019, and am a Marriott Bonvoy member.  This was my first business trip since the pandemic.  When I arrived, I was told I had to self park -- I get it.  Then I was given a room on the 3rd floor, when my profile says I want to stay on a higher level, so I rejected the first room.  When I got to my room, it faced a vacant building, no view.  There was detritus on the floor.  Then there was this wonky electric switch that was the master for the entire room.  Unknowingly, I turned it off when I went to bed, and then couldn't get the bathroom light to work in the morning.   I had to shower in the dark.  When I reported it to the front desk, they spoke with me like it was my fault.  Every time I tried to get into my room, my key wouldn't work and I had to go back down.",Real
"This hotel could not be better-managed, nor better staffed. I felt as though they treated us like we were family. Truly. Super attentive, super personable. We stayed during a busy Boston Marathon weekend and the extra attention to details was awesome. Gift bags, helpful directions on subways for race day, bananas and waters for runners to grab, nourishing fruit-infused water for all after the race. Lovely lobby receptions with Sam Adams beers. They knew our names. A boutique, personal experience in every way. Best Marriott experience, ever. Rooms incredibly spacious. Conveniences of all sorts. Felt very homey, we looked forward to returning each day. Wonderful beds, super clean. I put my 82 year old mom in a room with my sister and she's super picky. She loved it! ",Real
"Always a great stay at Courtyard Copley!  The staff are the best! So friendly! Especially Kim, Harry, and Joseph.  Thx for making our Boston Marathon stay wonderful!  Will definitely stay here again in future trips!",Real
"The hotel is clean, the rooms are spacious, and the staff is friendly, helpful, and professional. The Backbay location is perfect for sightseeing, shopping, and has many nearby restaurants, the Prudential Shopping Mall, and supermarkets too. The only drawback is the expensive per night price tag.",Real
"We stayed at the Lenox for 3 nights. Everything that the other reviews say about the service is absolutely true. We were always greeted when we arrived and the front desk staff was always helpful. I loved that the coffee and tea service was right at the elevators, so I could come down, grab a cup and go back up to the room without having to wander around looking for it. We ordered impromptu room service from Solas, one of the in house restaurants. It was so nice to enjoy room service without the inflated price. Location is close to Newbury Street shopping. After only 3 three nights, we still missed it when we left. It definitely felt like home.",Real
"We were here for parents weekend and although the hotel was busy, they checked us in quickly, allowing us to unwind before we met our party. The room is smallish, but comfy and the water is HOT! Location is amazing - can walk to pretty much everything  and very close to the train station... we'll definitely come back again...",Real
Lots of access to downtown shopping and eating. Only a block away from the Duck Tours. I crossed the Boston Marathon finish line 3 days before the race during the setup. Great place to stay in the HEART of Boston.,Real
"I don’t know why but we were upgraded to a corner fireplace room! Thank you, wonderful staff.  It was so cozy and wonderful to have a real fire and toast with some in-room Prosecco delivered. It’s gorgeous here and feels so homey.   The Lindor chocolates and stately clean, immaculate decor are just so wonderful.   Probably the nicest place I’ve ever stayed. Can’t wait to figure out a reason to return to Boston so I can stay here.",Real
Hotel is very nice and the staff is exceptional. The City Bar inside lobby is a popular place and stays busy…cool bar and great spot for drinks. Asked desk staff for recommendations about restaurants and all of them were spot on. Would definitely take any suggestions from them. The location is the best! It it centrally located to every thing we had planned. Lots of restaurants within walking distance too. I would definitely return.,Real
"We had a very enjoyable stay. The location is excellent, very close to many excellent restaurants , T-station. We also impressed by the personnel, especially Tony at front desk who welcomed and made us feel like home. The room that we stayed had a nice view. We will definitely recommend this hotel.",Real
"The Courtyard was the last hotel of our Fall Foliage Tour.  It was amazing.  We had a ninth floor view of The Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge.  Stunning!   The breakfast was cooked to order and delicious.  Our room was elegant, clean, comfortable, quiet, and easily darkened.  There is a T train stop only a few steps away.  Highly recommended.  ",Real
Good location and within walking distance to almost everything.  As all hotels in Boston it is expensive.  Had an issue with the tv would not turn off.  They sent an engineer up to disconnect since we would not be using.  Did not have a car but parking was $46 a day.  No complimentary breakfast so we went elsewhere.  Clean and staff mostly helpful.  12 minutes from airport.,Real
"Excellent hotel near a trolley stop, restaurants, and walking distance to all the historic sites!  Staff assisted us in getting trolley tickets and recommended we add the harbor cruise, which was phenomenal. Our rooms were quiet, spacious, and spotless.  Very comfortable beds. Sparkling bathrooms.",Real
"We stayed here at this location a year ago in the fall of 2020, and although the room itself was something very special, the area at the time, was like a ghost town at the time. This was of course, 6 months from the start of the Covid scares and shut downs. It wasn't like I remembered Boston when I was there as a teenager, when it was lively and fun. I wasn't in this particular area, which is next to the Stadium, so I imagine in better times, if you're there for a game, this would be a very exciting place to stay.  That being said, it was so quiet, too quiet! There were barely any folks in the streets, and when we went to dinner a few blocks away in the nearby Italian district, which was like a mini little Italy, there was no one in the street walking there.",Real
Came to Boston to watch a game at the Warrior Ice Arena. This place came recommended and it did not disappoint. Clean. Convenient. Amazing hospitality. Mega-unique. Charles River is across the street (see photo).,Real
"Though I have stayed here several times previously, our recent stay at Studio Allston Hotel on the 14th (Valentine's Day wkend) was the BEST one yet! The entire experience from the moment we checked in was spot on!! Many thanks to the entire team at this fun, funky, and fabulous hotel for always making us feel welcomed and special.  >> We love Studio Allston!",Real
"I usually don't expect high quality of service these days.. just became accustomed to subpar/bad service and accepted as norm.  Studio Allston proved me wrong.  Sure it's not a 5 star hotel costing thousand bucks a night but their service is 5 stars, no beyond 5 stars. Everyone, I mean everyone working there were so friendly and very quick to respond to questions or requests. It is now my go to place when visiting Boston.  Thanks everyone for a great time!!",Real
"My wife and I decided to take a ""micro"" vacation since we haven't been able to for some time (pandemic), so we decided on Boston.  Top choice in hotel was Studio Allston, and we are VERY happy that we chose it.  They had what was probably the most comfortable bed we've slept on in years and were even given a very inexpensive upgrade option to a suite.  Their restaurant was phenomenal and not crazy overpriced.  We did, however, stay during Halloween weekend and weren't aware that their restaurant/bar turned into a club on certain nights.  Not a big deal since we were able to head down and grab a few extra drinks!  Our average Lyft/Uber rides to downtown Boston were roughly $15, so needless to say it's pretty close to the heart of the city. ",Real
From the moment I walked in the front door I loved this hotel! Excellent customer service!  The decor is Art Deco awesome.  The hotel and room were immaculate.  I liked that I could open a widow for ventilation.  A standard continental breakfast.  ,Real
"Wonderful front desk and room service, excellent location, even allowed early check-in. The only negative thing was the mini fridges were locked due to COVID, so I had no wear to chill my fruit/leftovers. However, would still stay again.",Real
"Revisiting Boston from San Diego for our anniversary and decided to stay at the Intercontinental Hotel again. It never disappoints! This visit, however, has been exceptionally special as the staff has been very attentive and has gone above and beyond to make our stay extremely enjoyable and memorable. Specifically the management, Jack and John, along with the concierge staff of Rob and Adam, have attended to our every need and have made lots of suggestions to make our trip better than we could have imagined.   The room is spacious, clean and comfortable. All staff members from housekeeping to the bellmen have been friendly and have gone out of their way to get us what we needed and helped us in every way. We are so delighted that we came back and look forward to another stay.",Real
"Had the pleasure of staying here to do some sightseeing as it was my first time in Boston. My plan was to start with the Boston tea party museum. The Intercontinental is just next to the museum and overlooks the water/harbour area.  Perfect choice to be so close down town! Nice spacious rooms, pleasant staff - only slightly disappointed that being a IHG platinum customer I did not receive any special treatment like one usually gets in Europe (free drink in the bar voucher or fruit in the room).",Real
"Was just baffled when I checked in the intercontinental hotel. Lovely room as usual. The issue is that they give you no water in the room to drink and a locked fridge.   So I go to the front desk and ask about water. I am handed an 8 ounce bottle of drinking water. I asked for another and the agent reluctantly handed me two more. I asked could I buy a large bottle of premium water for coffee in the room, and the answer was the “manager is not here right now and he has the key.”    I find it strange that a four-star hotel forgets about drinking water in a room for guests paying a premium price. To consider in this age that you would use Covid as an excuse to strip your rooms of the small comforts is inexcusable. ",Real
"This was our first stay with any Intercontinental Hotel and it was disappointing all around. When we arrived to the room we noticed there was hair all over the bed and what appeared to be bodily fluid stains on the sheets. In addition, which we found most troubling was that a straight pin had been left on the floor of the room and my 2 year old daughter attempted to pick up and put in her mouth. To the hotel’s credit they did move us to a new room. The manger on duty also promised a room credit. Upon check out the front staff confirmed the credit but when we looked at the bill once we returned home the credit had not been applied. We contacted the property several times and where told they would look into and the last time we reached out they did not respond at all. ",Real
"We stayed for 3 nights in August while our daughter visited college in the area.  We loved the spacious rooms, location to restaurants, shopping, baseball game, etc.  Perfect location.  There were always taxi's waiting right next door.  Our room faced the courtyard so our sleep was quiet.     Housekeeping was great and our room was always cleaned early in the day.    A few things to note:   1.  There was no restaurant or bar as it is currently being renovated.  While plenty of alternatives in the area, not something you would expect from a 5 star hotel.   2.  It was 98 degrees our entire time in Boston,  I'm not sure how we got so unlucky with a major heat wave but the hotel could have provided more than just the 2 water dispensers in the lobby that were always empty. ",Real
"We stayed at the Mandarin during the Marathon weekend in Boston. If you are a spectator of the race, it is hard to beat the location, just a few hundred yards from the finish line. Depending on where the security checkpoints are, another hotel further down Boylston, like The Lenox for example, might be even better since you could - as a non-racer - get access closer to the finish. If you are a racer, then re-accessing the Mandarin from the finish is not too problematic since you can access through the attached shopping center The Prudential Center. The Prudential Center is also a convenient respite for non-racers who dont want to try and navigate crowds and checkpoints but just want to watch finishers outside the hotel front doors. About the hotel itself, a bit disappointing.",Real
"Great stay, impeccable room, as MO member got a late checkout and complementary breakfast every day, very close to the Haynes Convention Center,  property is surrounded by great restaurants, as the hotels’s main restaurant is closed right now. Room service was great.",Real
My stay at the Mandarin Boston was excellent. The room was clean and newly renovated. The staff was delightful. The safety and security measures taken at this property are exemplary. I will be back with my family and certainly recommend it to my friends.,Real
"We had 5 rooms and we were all very happy with our 17th visit to the Mandarin Oriental Boston.  Great service, quick responses,  and it is always a pleasure to stay there. The front desk was always smiling and happy to help. Room Service was great. All our room needs were met.",Real
"My husband and I spent a weekend in Boston and stayed at XV Beacon Hotel on Beacon Hill.  To say that the staff was fabulous is an understatement.  We were delighted with a gorgeous room that was bright and sophisticated and roomy.  The concierge, David, handled our dinner reservations and also arranged to have the hotel car transport us around.  He was a font of knowledge regarding our esact tastes .  The manager was so attentive and responsive to any issue we had  The location of the hotel is great.  a walk into the park and Beacon Hill.  All in all a great place to stay",Real
"Been on the road driving all week. My wife was nice enough to drive me around NY, NJ, MA and NH for meetings since I had injured my right arm. So I treated her to XV Beacon and got a great deal through my FoundersCard using my code FCDAN814 I got a big discount as I have at other hotels like XV Beacon.   WOW ! The staff are incredible and the hotel is so well kept does not show ageing. The furnishings and layout of the suite we had were top-notch. The fireplace was bouns with the windows open a little we could hear the rain and snuggle by the fire.  Food ""Room service"" was great and very fresh. we worked down the sides and they accommodate some diet issues.  Sunday had to get the Covid test and the hotel's car and driver took us and dropped us off.",Real
"I spent Halloween weekend here with my family. The rooms are immaculate. The staff truly goes out of their way to cater to your requests. We traveled with our 3 year old daughter whose extremely picky. We were provided everything we could need and more. My daughter really enjoyed the bubble fun bath salts. We ordered room service one night and enjoyed the Japanese A5 Wagyu. Upon arrival, Mengo working at Valet was a delight. Not only did he bring our bags up to the room but he also gave us a tour and showed us how to use the amenities. Built in speakers in the wall was perfect for a chill rainy night in the room. On Halloween, Jose, working in Valet gave us great tips in the best scenic area to take our daughter for a walk and Beacon Hill. He also brought our bags down.",Real
"Look no further as there is no finer place to stay than XV Beacon. I cannot say enough about this wonderful property. The location is fantastic and the ambience superb. The rooms are not only beautiful but extremely comfortable with every imaginable luxury and convenience.  What sets XV Beacon apart, however, is the wonderful people who work there. From the moment we arrived, they went out of their way to make us feel welcome. They went above and beyond at every turn, even taking very special care of our daughter’s misplaced stuffed duck until we could return to retrieve him.   Service this exceptional is rare indeed but has ensured there is no other place in Boston we will ever stay.",Real
"Staff so friendly and helpful,  love the decor and ambiance.  Things feel fresh.  Location is great to the Freedom Trail.. Enjoyed staying there much more than the Eliot Hotel.  No continental breakfast,  but high end hotels don't usually offer that unfortunately.   Great bathtub, they provided bed turn down.  I'll be back!",Real
"Charming room, luxurious rain shower, service was attentive but not intrusive. Staying at the XV Beacon on our trip to Boston was perfect! Bed was comfortable, robe and slippers cozy, bathroom was beautiful with plenty of counter space. They offered Chromecast which allowed us to watch movies and premium channels via our person subscriptions. Central location for both Beacon hill and Northside neighborhood restaurants as well as the TD Garden where we saw the Laver Cup.",Fake
"I stayed in Hilton while I was on a business trip in boston, the staff as well as management service were amazing and provided all the utilities, foods and drink at affordable cost. I'd highly recommend this hotel and their service to anyone who is looking to stay.",Fake
"The hotel staff was terrible and I didn't see a single sign of hospitality over here. They provided uncooked food, bathroom was messy as soon as I checked in, no facility for parking, no c0o-ordination between employees and manager. It was a complete waste of my money. Don't go to this hotel.",Fake
"They were prompt and provided good services. However, there were few things which I personally didn't expect like the valet was not available, swimming pool had dirty water and so on. But overall experience was just good but not best.",Fake
"This is like a heaven to me and all the hotel / resort services were wonderful. The hotel staff are so friendly like you will feel this place as your second home. We also did a party last night with their staff, one was very good at dancing and we did salsa together",Fake
"This is like one of my best experience to stay in this hotel, I'd avoid my home and stay in this hotel forever if I have lot of money like Elon Musk. Their food desk have several varieties and trust me I felt like I have having a food prepared by my mom. I love this place. Go guys and have fun...Bbye",Fake
"I am a multi billion dollar businessman and would not disclose my name for security reasons. But let me tell you that this hotel is worst to stay. Your should stay away from them. I asked them for an omlet but they provided me with a raw egg and asked to crack it by self, add ingredients of my choice and drink it right away.",Fake
I would stay in this hotel if I have very few options or limited option of hotels in Boston. Some of their services are good while some are worst. Lke food is good but rooms are messy. I'd suggest to have a look at hotel room physically before booking,Fake
"I would give negative starts to this hotel. They are very uprofessional and rude. I landed in Boston at night. It was snow storm and very cold. When I checked in their hotel, they asked if I had brought blanket (That was shocking to hear that), I asked who bring blanket while a stay in hotel, for their without a shame they provided me with a checque to pay for blanket if I have to stay in this hotel. Because I had not other option I did that. Then after 2 hours my room electricity went off, I called their management desk and they told if I wanted to stay more, I had to pay electircity bills also. Such a shame. In the morning when I was checking out my blanket they asked me to keep the blanket in my room as a courtesy to hotel hospitality. Such a bad experiece. Don;t even go this hotel.

"This Hotel is amazing and their services are stunning. Like once I was just getting up from my bed to order a coffeee, within a second their staff was standing at my door with a coffe mug. I asked him how did you know so he told ""Sir hospitality is our responsibility"" I was literaaly amazed and still thinking what technology they are using that neither Mark Zuckerberg have.",Fake

"Excellent hotel and staff close to Times Square. Our room was equipped with everything we needed plus garment bags, slippers, Robes, fabric travel bags etc. coffee was a quick hop down the elevator. We had an amazing sushi restaurant and night club on site and we’re a 5 minute walk to Times Square. The staff were so polite and helpful and saved us $500 USD on our Covid tests by pointing us in the right direction to free same day tests to get back to Canada. I’d stay here again for my next NY trip.",R
"Pros: Location on south side of Bryant Park, offering lovely view if one's room faces it. The view - and proximity to the park and all things midtown - is pretty exceptional for NYC, meeting if not exceeding our high expectations. Renovated hallways & rooms. Spa-like bathroom: large shower with fixed & handheld shower heads, quality tiling, large soaking tub & well-lit vanity. CLEAN! Coffee & muffins available in the morning near reception. Well-themed cocktail lounge named Celon within hotel. Cons: Bed mattress could have been more supportive. FYI: 1) Very modern, minimalistic decor within rooms. 2) Obviously like all hotels at this time, some service aspects (e.g., reception area that is utilized) are adapted, but this did not impact our experience.",R
"My ‘Go To’ favorite hotel in New York! Why? Boutique hotel with very helpful, professional and friendly staff. Excellent location directly across the street from Bryant Park and the NY City Library in Midtown. Beautiful, spacious Junior Suite with huge windows overlooking the park (my room was 607). Huge shower and separate bath. Great hot water and water pressure. By far best hotel room I’ve ever had in NYC. Of course, it was a junior suite. Firm but comfortable bed. Excellent A/C. Spotlessly clean room. Thanks to all the guys at the front desk who were so help as well as the housekeeping staff who do such a great job! I look forward to seeing you again soon.",R
"I have been wanting to stay at The Bryant Park Hotel Forever. 3 of our trips were cancelled during 2020 so I was so excited about finally being able to stay there. The experience from start to finish was beyond our expectations. The hotel is beautiful and we were very comfortable in our room. It was very spacious and the decor and feel of the room created a great environment. The location is perfect - Bryant Park at your front door, wonderful restaurants surrounding the hotel, subway a quick walk away, stores (Walgreens etc) conveniently close. Our favorite thing about The Bryant Park Hotel were the incredible employees though. From the booking to the check out, they made every interaction fun and personable. It was an instant connection with them. Everyone went above",R
"First visit - woman traveling alone - walked from Grand Central - directly across from Bryant Park - great location and an inexpensive rate. Front desk is literally a desk located just inside the entrance. Restaurant to the right and cocktail lounge to the left. Elevators are dark and small and paneled in red pleather. Whole property is a bit dated - has seen better days. Queen sized room was a decent size for NYC. Sofa, table, side table. Big closet. During non-pandemic times, there seems to be an honor bar. No coffee maker, no microwave. No iron. Big bathroom with rain shower head. Furniture has seen better days. Worn. Comfortable bed. Good towels. Very quiet on a Wednesday night. Ask for the security key fob if you'll be out past 11pm.",R
"Wonderful hotel! Amazing location and even better service. Danny at the front desk was so friendly and made me feel very welcome. The rooms are really clean, with comfortable beds and sleek bathrooms.",R
"Gorgeously appointed rooms, immaculate hotel, and truly caring staff that went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Miguel and Scott, thanks for taking care of our reservation change of the wonderful upgrade to celebrate my husband’s birthday. We will return for sure.",R
"Staff were very helpful and professional. The rooms were really lovely, clean, comfortable and beyond my expectations. The location is perfect for a weekend in the city and I would highly recommend it.",R
"From the minute you arrive you are made to feel welcome. We were greeted by the smiles of Job & Sarah at the front desk. The Bryant Park Hotel was a wonderful choice for a weekend get away. The rooms are beautiful, love the beds,the view of the park and perhaps the best shower ever. The location is great for walking and close to Broadway, Public Library,& of course the park. Angel at The Celon Bar (a beautiful spot for cocktails & dancing) was a treat not only for his drinks but also his singing. We had breakfast at Koi and the food was delicious and Kelvin provided amazing service for our table of 7.A special thank you to Darren Sumner for his personal attention in putting this together for us. Bryant Park Hotel super special! Donna and Guillermo Chacon",R
"When we arrived in our room, there was a bad odor. When I called the front desk, they responded immediately and resolved it by upgrading our room, even though we were able to trace the source of the smell and remove it. They couldn't have been more gracious. They also helped me to plan for a 75th Birthday by getting flowers and champagne etc in the room, and they even left a little gift. The bed was possibly the best ever from any hotel we've ever stayed in, including Four Seasons etc. The only drawback to a good night's sleep was that the room darkening shades were not. There was plenty of ambient light that got through. The bathroom was large and the shower was glorious. The only drawback here is that for two people, there was not enough countertop space for toiletries. I",R
"Such a wonderful spot to visit. Lots of people around, but that's NYC! Everyone was so helpful and the hotel was very clean! Have to compliment the bartenders! They made great drinks and were so friendly!",R
"We live in Connecticut and visit our son, his wife and our wonderful granddaughter frequently. Typically we stay at the hotel with the best deal. This weekend and last we had a great experience at the Bryant Park Hotel. The rooms and bathrooms are exceptionally large for New York. A park view is fantastic. They have free water, turndown service and a very friendly staff. We will be back.",R
"As always the Bryant Park Hotel is the perfect NYC hotel. It is a short walk from Penn Station, a short walk to Times Square and in the Winter it is right outside the Winter Wonderland at Bryant Park. The hotel is great and helped us celebrate our 20th anniversary with Champagne and Chocolates. Thanks for a great Stay!",R
The Bryant Park hotel is a luxury hotel and it is overlooking Bryant Park. The service is perfect and the prices are... almost reasonable. Perfect place. The Koi restaurant who also provide breakfast (not to par with nearby places) is an excellent place to lunch or diner.,R
"The Bryant Park Hotel is my go-to hotel in NYC. It's not a chain, it's a cool indie, in a great location, with super staff, perfectly sized comfortable rooms and very clean bedding. But have breakfast at the Mayson Kaiser a few doors down, it's so good. I've put up business guests there as well, and everyone loves it.",R
"Fabulous location, charming hotel, I’ve stayed here before in one of the smaller rooms they are petite but very well-designed, we had one of those booked but the manager Miguel gave us an upgrade to a deluxe queen with a view, which was SUCH a treat, sheer luxury! The staff is so friendly and helpful and I also love that this hotel does not have carpeting in the rooms, very good for people with asthma or allergies.",R
We were a bit overwhelmed with choice for NYC hotels and everything was expensive for Christmas but really pleased with our choice. Lovely room - sizeable with small sitting area and ours looked to be one of the smallest (so the others must be massive!) - super comfortable bed and one of the best showers I have ever used! Would happily return. Only improvement I would suggest was in room coffee machine/kettle.,R
"We spend four days in NYC every fall/winter. Bryant Park hotel is our go to place! Great centrally located hotel! Staff is great and attentive, close to theater, restaurants, and a nice walk up town or down town. We highly recommend this hotel for your NYC stay!",R
"Was in NYC for a couple of nights and another hotel was booked for me. It was a disappointing place and after one night I decided to move to The Bryant Park Hotel, where I had stayed two times before. To make a long story short: it was once more fantastic! You simply can’t go wrong with this place - it’s truly the best choice in the city. Room and bathroom: clean, comfortable and spacious! (for a fair price) Location: mid town, at Bryant Park, which is nearby everything. Staff: always kind and helpful (thank you Dennis, Aishley and Miguel at the front desk). Design and atmosphere of the hotel: modern and cool! And as an extra asset there is the very cool club in the basement. This hotel is by far my top favorite on Manhattan. Highly recommended!",R
"My wife and I routinely do theater weekends in NYC and years ago found the Bryant Park Hotel as our home in the city. We've had countless stays and each visit it better than the last. When walking in Saturday morning, John greeted us by name with a huge smile and handshake. You can tell he truly cares about guests. Every staff member was, as always, upbeat and friendly. Our room was immaculate as always, minimalist but still elegant. Seeing Miguel, who has gone out of his way to make us feel at home every time, Sunday evening as we were leaving was the icing on the cake. The addition of coffee and water in the elevator lobby is a nice touch! Can't wait to return back home in a few months.",R
"Visited NYC for work- great location, modern rooms with all the amazing amenities, and staff who actually appreciate your business to ensure to have an awesome stay... and return! From doorman to front desk staff- it was a pleasure! NYC hospitality!",R
"Wow! This was the absolute perfect hotel for everything we wanted to do in NYC. We had two beautiful suites overlooking the park. The suites were spacious, comfortable, and beautiful! The location was fantastic, and we walked to three fabulous dinners. Our daughter ran her first marathon, and she did REALLY well. We think that her great night of sleep made all the difference. The team was amazing - friendly, professional, and helpful! We look forward to our next visit. We are “travel snobs”, and we recommend this hotel to the most discerning of travelers! :)",R
"Great hotel, great location & great staff! Very clean with comfortable bed and amazing shower. Got upgraded to a junior suite overlooking Bryant Park. Didn’t try hotel bar or restaurant but plenty of choices nearby. Will definitely stay here again.",R
"My daughter and I booked a junior suite (room 909) which was very spacious with a large living room, a dining room table and a king size bed. The views of Bryant Park and the city were quite nice. The refrigerator was actually cold, a rare treat. We appreciated the Molton Brown toiletries, bathrobes and the soft thick towels. The only complaint was the outlets wouldn't keep a charger plugged in, kept falling out. The front desk staff and the doormen were very cordial and aimed to please. Would have liked a Keurig in the room instead of going downstairs for morning coffee.",R
I am thankful for Miguel and Job at the desk. They treated my family and I with outstanding hospitality and service. My wife became ill and we were put up in a beautiful room! I mean this place is spotless and modern. The guys got me in through Hotel Tonight in literally 5 minutes. It makes me want to visit again soon. I love New York!,R
"We arrived the Bryant Park Hotel just prior to the Labour Day Public Holiday The staff are very friendly & accommodating Our initial room a step up from standard however like many New York rooms was very small not even enough room for our cases The breakfast area fortunately had both inside seating & alfresco, this was needed as seating & food was at a premium because the hotel was fully booked Also due to the hotel being full the flow on affect was the lifts were very slow We had to travel to Chicago for 2 days & the hotel allowed us to store our bags in their holding area which was good Upon our return the Labour Day Holiday was over we upgraded our new room to a suite- fantastic could actually get to our cases without climbing over things With less guests the breakfast",R
"My husband and I have just returned from our second stay at the Bryant Park Hotel having stayed for 10 nights last year. We were not disappointed all the staff from check in at reception ,concierge, security staff and housekeepers they were all extremely friendly efficient and professional. The room was spotlessly clean and the turn down service excellent along with the Moulton Brown toiletries. We were always greeted with a friendly smile from all the security staff when we left and returned to the hotel. The Koi restaurant was as good as last year and a must for any visitor. The view of the park was amazing and this is certainly the only hotel we will stay in when visiting New York. Thank you Bryant Park for another super holiday.",R
"First time in New York, and I have to say that the staff at the Bryant Park Hotel are hands down the best in the business. I was checked in by John upon arrival. Having driven quite a distance my 7 year old had to use the facilities and even though we were extremely early for check in, John accommodated my son and I without hesitation he had us booked in a room and ready to go within minutes even though we were almost three and a half hours early. The room was very large, very clean and we had a beautiful view of Bryant Park. I was very nervous about driving and parking in the city so we opted for valet parking, which again was very seamless and so very convenient. I don't of course know all the staff members names, but every single one of the was courteous, kind and so",R
"Stayed for my birthday weekend, and had the best time! Ashley and Emily were both so helpful with anything I needed. Everything was beautiful and the service was impeccable! Beautiful room and view! I will definitely be back!!",R
"A lifelong NY-er (who recently left), I'm hard to impress. But this has become my go-to home-away-from-home when I visit the city. The bed, the bathroom, the proximity to the park, the sushi...I could go on and on and on. The front desk team -- Miguel and Dennis -- are truly amazing. I can't imagine staying anywhere else. If I could give it six stars, I would!",R
"My wife and I recently got to stay at the Bryant Park Hotel. It had been a couple of years since we were in New York and we were glad that the Hotel continues to provide top notch customer service, looks great, has added amenities, and is so central to everything. As we were getting out of our Lyft, Matthew greeted us and welcomed us back to the Hotel. He took us into Yasmin at the front desk, who cheerfully introduced herself, welcomed us back, gave us bottles of water and told us about the changes at the Hotel since our last stay two years ago, which included a new morning coffee and muffin service and a complete overhaul of their bar venue. The customer service is top notch and we always feel like the most important guest in the Hotel when we stay there. Yasmin",R
All I have to say is WOW! Booked a room for my parents 30th year anniversary and Miguel and Job upgraded our room free of charge! I have never received better service! Highly recommended staying here!,R
"We loved this hotel! We were able to check in early, and efficiently. Very friendly and helpful staff. We received bottles of water upon check in. Room was large, bathroom was large. Lovely decor! We will definitely stay here again!",R
"It was a very nice stay in the center of Manhattan,near ther Bryant Park,a vibrant place with a lot of events during the evenings,with nice terraces,good air and nice people to meet.The hotel itself is expensive but the location is one of the best for New York.You have between 6 to 8 am a complimentary coffee and muffin only breakfast,water in the lobby,very clean rooms and very good services.I,ll be back",R
"My wife and I travelled to NY for just a few days to see a play and explore Manhattan. We chose the hotel because it was near the Hudson theater and directly across from Bryant park. We were thrilled to be in such a wonderful location and it didn't disappoint in any way. The view of the park was wonderful from our room and my wife really appreciated the sitting bench by the window. The staff was great, the restaurant was delicious, the rooms were modern and spacious. It was a great time and I'll definitely stay here again next time I come out this way.",R
"The Bryant Park Hotel is a great place to stay when you are in NYC. The location is ideal as Bryant Park has so many wonderful things going on as well as just a nice place to grab a snack and hang out. The hotel is so welcoming from the doormen to the check in staff to the housekeeping. They are very accommodating and helpful. We have been to NYC many times and have stayed in many hotels and the Bryant Park Hotel is by far our favorite. The rooms are relatively spacious and very clean. The bathrooms are a nice size and asking for extra towels was never a problem. I’d like to mention names specifically, but I can’t remember a specific name. It doesn’t matter though because there wasn’t one person who worked there that wasn’t kind and nice. Stay there next time you need a place",R
"We stayed here for five nights and found the location to be very convienent if you are going to be going uptown and downtown. I don't usually like to stay so close to Times Square but we had events uptown, a broadway show, and love going to the east and west villages. There is a subway station at the end of the block and Bryant Park is across the street. We had a one bedroom suite and it was super spacious, especially for NY!!! Javier, along with the rest of the staff were all helpful, friendly, and professional. Would definitely stay here again.",R
"From valet to checkout and all in between it was 5Star as expected for an amazing price. Thanks to the staff for always making us feel welcomed, even during The Manhattan Blackout 2019. (thanks for having power)",R
"I stayed at Bryant Park Hotel only for one night during a business trip. It is a very nice hotel, the room was big, clean and comfortable. Great service and staff, and beautiful view on the Park. Hope I will stay again for more nights.",R
"This was my 3rd stay at the hotel and as always it was great. The location is fantastic you walk out of the hotel right into Bryant Park, Times Square is right around the corner. And there is almost always something to do right in Bryant Park. The staff is great and always helpful with sight seeing and cool things to do. And the restaurant attached ""koi"" is top notch. Unless something changes I will always stay at the Bryant Park Hotel when visiting the city.",R
"This is a European-style hotel -- everything you need but no frills, at least in the queen bed room I had. The bathroom was huge, a nice change for NYC. What really stood out for me was the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff. I checked in fairly late in the evening to a friendly greeting, the restaurant staff were prompt and warm, and the bellperson who took my bag for storage during my meeting asked without my mentioning it whether I would need a taxi for the airport later in the day (I did, and it was there right on time). Great for business travel (the onsite restaurant wouldn't be my first choice with kiddos, but there are of course tons of other options just steps away). Will stay again!",R
"Would 100% recommend this hotel. From the moment we arrived and were greeted by Job on reception who helped us with our check in and informed us of our complimentary upgrade, to the moment we checked out and were helped by Jonathan who called us a taxi, waited with us and helped us with our bags into the taxi, we were made to feel very welcome by every member of staff we met. As soon as we walked through the front doors we were greeted every time and a lift called for us (which came pretty instantly) we stayed on the 12th Floor and had amazing views of the park, library and 6th Avenue. Yes the hotel is a little on the pricy side but the location and the service is worth it. Situated on 40th Street we were a 5 minute walk away from Times Square, there was a subway entrance just",R
"I have been staying at the Bryant Hotel for the last 10 years. Service is always impeccable. The staff are friendly, professional and go out of their way to help. The hotel is in a fabulous location, opposite Bryant Park. It's a great place to sit and relax before and after work",R
"My wife and I stayed here for our 5 year anniversary. The staff were polite and friendly. While we stayed there, we never had to wait to get help at the front desk. We got a balcony room on the 19th floor and it was WONDERFUL. It's by far the largest room I've stayed in in New York and the balcony view of Bryant Park was spectacular. Even ignoring the balcony, we had a lot of windows and plenty of space. As easily seen on a map, the location is great too. It's right across the road from the very pretty and fun Bryant Park.",R
Staying here after my hotel messed up my reservation. Wonderful stay. Everyone you come across is very service focused. Room was fantastic- large for NYC. Absolutely and without question the very best bathroom I’ve ever had; water pressure remarkable for NYC..... will most certainly return! Thanks Bryant Park x,R
"A last minute booking brought us here. As soon as we pulled up outside the hotel we were met by Job from the front desk who helped with ""valeting"" the car and checking us in. Reception was full of friendly faces. Job made sure our one night experience was memorable. Our bellman Chiran, from Nepal was delightful as he took us to our room with our luggage. The location was perfect, overlooking Bryant Park and close to Times Square. All in all what makes the hotel a place to go back to (at least our second visit) and recommend it to our friends and post a five star review on TA is the staff and their passion to make you happy. We would give them all a big hug but these days that might be misconstrued !",R
"Seamless service from the moment we walked in the door. Room was bigger than expected and had a great view of Bryant Park. Spacious bedroom and bathroom, all very tastefully equipped. Great visit - wish we could have stayed longer!",R
"I came to the Bryant Park Hotel back in January to celebrate my birthday and I booked their Bryant Park Suite and it was a minimalist's dream come true! a decadent, luxurious room that had a living room two bathrooms and a very big center room. The amenities both in my room and within the hotel were wonderful. The hotel also has a restaurant KOI right alongside of it if you want to stay in with amazing, state of the art Asian cuisine. Lastly, the hotel has a great nightlife where the bar also doubles as a ambient lounge/club scene after 12. I also had the hotel's breakfast through room service on the night of my departure and it was absolutely delicious and full of a variety of options for those big on breakfast, highly recommend. My favorite part was definitely the beautiful",R
It is very nice hotel and service was also very good.,F
"Such a stupid hotel, I wont recommend it if your are getting for free also.",F
I and my wife went for our anniversry and it�s a terrible experience at that night. We were forced to leave that place at midnight and we were helpless.,F
"We went for trip to newyark from india. We stayed there for 5 days and it is an excellent place to stay. We feel very comfortable and safe over there, As this is new place to us. ",F
Good place to stay,F
"We went to bryant hotel for office meeting and its very good place. We have an amazing after party, the view from balcony you cant complain about it.",F
"We were very pleasantly accommodated. Location, service, valet, restaurant, rooms and most importantly, the staff, were all 5 star. Will definitely come back",F
The room was very clean and spacious. Easy to organize your stuff for a longer stay. Excellent location  Very handicap accessible. No room service or room cleaning. They were pretty busy. Hotel restaurant was more fancy so expensive not really kid friendly food. The bonus was it is open until midnight if you are desperate for real food. The snack shop and laundry facilities were convenient. The terrace on the 3rd floor is cute and peaceful. The pool is 4 ft deep everywhere and on the smaller side so not little kid friendly. Overall it was a nice hotel and I would stay here again.,F
"Super location, great staff and very nice facility",F
"What a wonderful stay! I had to make a last minute booking and my stay was affordable, and extremely comfortable! The staff was lovely, very helpful and friendly. The room was clean and spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. Best night sleep I've had in a while! I will definitely be visiting again!",F
"New hotel, very nice. Walk to restaurants. Enjoyed our stay. Would stay here again.",F

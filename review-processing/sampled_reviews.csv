A beautiful and iconic hotel with a wonderful staff that goes beyond to take care of their guests! We took full advantage of the scenic courtyard and even used the facilities to take anniversary photos! We cannot wait to stay again!	F
Great service. Cute decor, comfy beds. Nice lounge with a good selection of wine. We also had the chicken caeser salad and it was delicious. Would recommend. Dog friendly with a super close area to walk them (including poop bag stand)	F

,terrible service - no one answering phone at front desk to stop noisy neighbor in the mid of night. picture looks deceiving. dated room. bathroom ceiling and floor leaking stains. I stayed there last night. I pick millennium times square for its location and good price. But it turned out to be a nightmare because no front desk response to call to stop noise from next door.,F
,"I would like to thank the front desk manager named Syed. He is very friendly and helped to solve a very important issue for me in a short period of time! In general, a special thanks to Syed. If you want your vacation to be unclouded by any detail, start your hotel accommodation with the manager of Syed! He will help you in everything! A very good specialist and just a nice person! Thanks to this hotel for such a wonderful employee! Thanks Syed",F
,"I heard about this on dance-rock radio, decided to give it a try. Best Hotel",F
,"Buyer beware!!! Do not believe the stars. We booked two rooms: one room with 2 double beds and one with one queen bed. The rooms and hallways are tired, worn and dirty (so much staining on the carpets). I could clorox every surface but had to stop at the walls! It's dark and dingy inside. The bathroom had mold and mildew as well as old caulking. One of our double beds had stained sheets. The bedding left something to be desired.....flat pillows and an old ""quilt"" that looked more like a mattress pad. Thankfully the front desk staff was nice and let us out of our four night stay after just one night! I believe the reason this property still has so many stars is because it was a former Hilton property, but maintenance clearly stopped once Hilton dropped it. I do not recommend!",F
,"Beware of HIDDEN FEES! I stayed 2 nights in the past October, and paid beforehand. 2 weeks later, I noticed my credit card was charged an extra $68.87. They explained it was a mandatory facility fee, $30 a night, plus tax. But it was NOT highlighted at their website at all. If it's mandatory, it should have been included when I paid for the booking. The room was fine. Not terrible, but definitely old. I stayed at a room with Times Square view on the 44th floor. The windows look like they haven't been cleaned for years. Shower water pressure was so strong it hurt a little, and no matter how you close the curtain, the dry area always flood a little afterwards. Don't pay close attention to the furnitures, carpet, wall corners, there are stains and cracks and god knows what.",F

1,The staff is very attentive to all needs. From doorman to concierge to front desk. Rita & Annie were very nice. It‚Äôs lovely to go to a hotel that when you show up the next week they welcome you back like a permanent resident! Thanks Team for making me feel like family!,Real
2,"Best hotel in Vancouver for price range. Most modern and well built hotel rooms. State of the art. No expense spared... sort of like his presidential campaign I guess. Service was second to none, probably some of the best I've experience throughout the world of travelling and staying at 5 star hotels. Location is spot on for brief trips to vancouver or business travel. House Car service was valuable for us. Very generous with early check in and late check out too. Would stay again and would also look favorably towards booking within this chain around the world now as a result of our experience / stay.",Real
3,"I cant say enough good things about this establishment. It is by far the best hotel i have stayed at in vancouver, all the amenities are flawless. The staff is flawless and knowledgeable. Very little room for improvement over all.  The only hotels that can compete in this city were always atleast 100 dollars more per night. If the name on the front door turns you away.grow up and realize that is getting in the way of the best weekend youve ever had in vancouver.",Real
4,Best hotel we‚Äôve ever been to the staff are so nice and welcoming DONT make you feel out of place even though we were probably the youngest people there. The bed was the comfiest bed I‚Äôve ever slept on.,Real
5,"It is a nice hotel, but nothing special. I do not think it is worth the money, the Mott 32 restaurant breakfast is $42 per person and you can eat better at Mcdonalds. Most of the staff do not speak good English and they are hard to understand.",Real
6,"Excellent customer experience. Hotel staff was friendly and extremely knowledgeable and helpful. From the front desk when checking in to the time of check out the service was impeccable. Prior to check in our vehicle was valet parked, we had high tea in the champagne lounge which was absolutely a treat and staff once again knowledgeable. Our room was much larger to what one we have experienced when travelling and room was spotless, full the most up to date technology and just what we needed to relax for a few nights before departing home, The hotel is central in the city of Vancouver and a our first time to the city we were central and near to  some beautiful restaurants and coffee shops. Thank you to Brent who recommend the hotel. A first class experience. The only downside if",Real
7,Trump Tower delivered on all aspects of my stay. I must admit this was one of my best hotel stays to date. I hope Trump Tower hotels are available for more of my travel needs throughout the rest of 2020.,Real
8,"The impression of the hotel was excellent from beginning.  I drove a rented vehicle to arrive the hotel for check-in.  The valet parking staff was very friendly and helpful.  The staff from housekeeping, in-room dining, Mott 32 and the lounge were doing a perfect job. I will stay there again.",Real
9,Beautiful Hotel in a perfect position in downtown . Very big and well furnished room. Spectacular view. Good in-room service. Very beautiful SPA with a wonderful party pool. Excellent service. Worth the price.,Real
10,"Top to bottom,  they are an excellent study in :""team work"".   From Mr. Frasier that greeted us out front, to the dinning Room staff,  the daily room attendants,  the room service, to the work-out gym attendants,  they all are highly trained, pleasant folks to interact with. They are the epitome of ""Team Work"".",Real
11,We loved this hotel and stayed twice over the last year.  Incredibly clean and inviting!   The staff so polite and welcoming!  The location is perfect and also close to the water!   Absolutely one of our favorite hotels to stay!,Real
12,Very professional staff  Classy and efficients Cocktail and breakfast excellent  Not to mention rooms modern luxury with all raffinements and domotic  you are entitled to have in this kind of hotel Congrats,Real
13,This place is first class! Every detail has been thought about! Super professional & friendly staff! Great valet service for the car! The swimming pool and spa was fantastic! The heated floors in the room were a big plus! The views from the 18th floor were breathtaking! The beds were the best! This is a 5 star place!,Real
14,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel as a treat for her birthday! Overall we loved it. The room was clean and had a lot of nice touches. The shades and blinds are electric. The television was huge. There is a shower cap in the room in one of the little boxes. If you open it, it also has a hair tie which we thought was a nice touch that most companies don‚Äôt think of. The amentity bottles are large. We found the bed very comfortable but the pillows were too soft. We couldn‚Äôt fold them enough to make them firm. The Only cleanliness issue was the water glasses. It seemed that they had toothpaste residue from a previous guest. The turn down attendant and the in room dining server were both very nice. We had only ordered dessert but the flavours were fantastic and the plating was",Real
15,Great hotel for seeing Vancouver. Super location close to shops and waterfront. Exceptional service from checking in staff. Very helpful and friendly- important in a city hotel. Good advice on how to spend our time in the city.,Real
16,We booked the Trump hotel and enjoyed of our selection. They have perfect stuff. The internet was excellent. Foods were delicious with best quality. Services were excellent. They cleaned the room twice a day. They  charged mini bar everyday. Tank you.,Real
17,"Very modern, quite large room with all buttons operated üòÅTo open the curtains, to turn on/off the lights and tv, with very beautiful touchscreen panel. Quite interesting experience. Very good location. Beautiful view from our big windows. Just minutes walk to the famous Robson street. It‚Äôs worth to try! Thank you for the wonderful stay experiences with you! All the best!",Real
18,"We went for the night expecting the worst. Just for fun. Everyone was so nice and chill. It is very expensive. But we have been back and will certainly be returning. It is fancy, but not snobby. The pool is awsome. The bath tub in the room is also great.",Real
19,This was an amazing hotel experience. The Trump hotel brand we experienced was incredible and there were no pictures of Donald Trump or retail shops selling MAGA/KAG gear. The service was the best we have ever had and people of all nationalities and ethnicities were enjoying their stay in the most sophisticated building in downtown Vancouver. NO politics just amazing service!!! Any other hotel in Vancouver would be unthinkable.,Real
20,I wish all hotels were run so professional like Trump Hotel Vancouver. The place is spotless! All of the staff was so friendly and willing to help or answer questions. They didn‚Äôt avoid guests like some places,Real
21,"Firstly, although we have had several stays in Trump hotels that have been wonderful, this last one seemed lacking in what is expected to be a luxury hotel as noted in the 3 star review. My husband and I have stayed in this particular Trump hotel once before, as well as Trump SoHo previously. We absolutely loved the level of service, amenities, and luxury accommodations. However, we were left disappointed this last stay when we came for one night on our way hone from Whistler. We got there early at 2:00 and were told our room would not be ready until check in which is officially 3:00. This was fine, so we ate at their on site Chinese restaurant (fantastic food!) and came back at 3:00. The suite was still not ready, we were told they would call us when it was (they had double",Real
22,"Trump hotels and resorts always do it best. Our stay in Trump International Hotel & Tower Vancouver was awesome. The room we stayed in are fabulous, spotlessly clean, spacious, ample of sunlight, well lit and so high tech! Turndown service is rare these days, but not with the Trumps - kids love the surprises. The hotel bars and restaurants are awesome too - good food and drinks. We had the Oyster and Champagne Happy Hour - highly recommended! We love the pool - it was great and it is different - worth checking out. Interactions with the hotel staff were all pleasant, but one staff in particular - Annie, was top notch in her customer service, communication and resolution skills (we're very impressed!). Location of the hotel is good, close to the shopping area with plenty of great",Real
23,A very delightful stay.  The best service and very friendly and patient employees.  They welcomed questions and was eager to help you. Would be delighted to stay again and would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to stay.,Real
24,"Overall, we love the Trump Hotel, in particular, the extra level of personal service by Frasier. He took the time and effort to say hello as well as being sincere in all his conversations with myself and my family.   The downsides to this trip were with the front desk staff. When we checked-in, we had to wait 1.5 hours after 3pm (~4:30pm local time) before our room was ready. When we finally checked in, the front desk said that a late check out would be no problem. So when I called for a late check out, esp. since we had to wait 1.5 hours when we checked in, they said that they could not accommodate the request. It was only after repeated requests and an explanation of our check-in experience that they only gave 1 hour. For this incident, I would say that the staff at the front",Real
25,"My room was smaller than I expected from the Trump brand, after staying at Trump Las Vegas. The layout was strange, and absent of good 'flow'. It was immaculately clean though, and I liked the shower vent and bathroom mirrors.",Real
26,"Toilet light not working, had to call twice to get it fixed. Drapes not closing 100%. Nespresso not working, pod stuck on the machine for idk how long - it's gross! Washroom though was almost spotless!",Real
27,Nothing compares to Trump tower. We can‚Äôt stay away! You get what you pay for. Pamper yourself and ‚Äúget it right for romance & decadence!!‚Äù Mott 32...second to none! Reservations a must. How can food taste THAT good?,Real
28,"I stayed in room 1808. Room was spacious, magnificent views, and welcoming and friendly staff. Place was clean, bed comfy (although initially quite hard, I asked for a softer mattress and it seems they complied). Gigantic TV, somewhat noisy but acceptable aircondition, and a sophisticated ‚Äútablet-style‚Äù system for controlling room lighting, blinds, curtains e.t.c. Large shower.  Only underwhelming part was the gym, which is not that big and has a large selection of cardio machines, but only a few weight machines, no barbells (only dumbbells) and a no smith rack, all things I would expect at a hotel of this size.",Real
29,"This was our first time staying at the Trump  Towers and we were not disappointed.  Staff was amazing very professional and accommodating.  Room was amazing with many extra details.  Fine china for coffee, heated floors and much more.",Real
30,"Our first trip to Vancouver and the staff at the Trump Hotel were extremely friendly and their service was above and beyond. They treat everyone like a VIP and the room we stayed in was clean, modern and first class. The valet guys even drew us a map to visit Whistler, which we did and it was an awesome experience. First Rate Hotel. You will not be disappointed.",Real
31,"We stay at different hotels when we come to Vancouver to visit family. I have been spoiled and won‚Äôt stay at any other hotel Classy, clean modern hotel.  Service was excellent in the Champagne lounge.  Our 2 queen bedroom with wood flooring was spacious with all the high end touches. Electric drapes and shades to the touch screen lights.  The vanity in the tile washroom, has 2 sinks.  Nice size glass shower, and closet toilet for privacy. In room nespresso machine with China tea cups! I can‚Äôt wait for my next trip to Vancouver to stay at the Trump hotel.",Real
32,from arrival to checkin to departure all staff were friendly and courteous.  When car was brought on departure they asked if we wanted water and asked to take the old bottle in the cup holder for recycling.  Room had automatic controls for lighting and shades with day and night settings.  A wonderful stay and we will be back.,Real
33,I stayed here overnight on business and enjoyed my stay.  This is a great hotel with nice rooms and excellent service.  The food I ate at the hotel was also excellent.  My only complaint is that the rooms are all fairly low down as the top half of the tower is made up of condos.  This limits the views.  I need a new place to stay with my family now that the 4S is closing.  I will bring them here next time we come to town but need to figure out the best room setup for this.,Real
34,Good service is important. Great service is rare. This staff works under the latter banner and each interaction impressed. The facility is awesome. My room was not huge (not New York small) but was more than adequate and was well appointed. No problem recommending this quality property and team to be your hosts.,Real
35,"This was our first day at a Trump property and it won‚Äôt be the last .  Staff and service here was impeccable . That is exactly what you would expect from a high-end property .  It is an odd entry situation if you come in off Georgia Street you have to walk through the restaurant down to the lobby or otherwise you go around the back and enter in with your car into an alley that takes you to the lobby .  The room was very chic and modern and  minimalistic and  very nicely designed however ours was on the small side.   The bed was very comfortable everything in the room seems to be very well thought out, nice espresso coffee machine .  Very nice shower and bathroom setting with two sinks .  Love the whole digital set up for your curtains lighting etc. nice big screen TV   Highly",Real
36,"Arrived near midnight but staff was in high gear in every way.  Room, food, service top of the line.  Not only that, but my wife liked the pillows so much we inquired about purchasing two of them and Mr. David Lall, Director of Guest Services came to the front desk and had us set up for purchase and home delivery within minutes.  He made sure they weren't shipped too soon so they would get here after we arrived back home. It all made for a great way to start out Alaska Cruise.",Real
37,"The Trump Hotel is fabulous! I had a business trip to Vancouver, and was able to get a room here for a few nights. This place oozes class. The room was the best. The bar was inviting and trendy. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I will definitely 100% stay here again in the future.",Real
38,Location is downtown and close to active areas like shopping and Stanley park and the waterfront and the English Bay. The staff is pleasant and the service is great. The room is very clean and tidy. The size of the deluxe room is reasonable. If you are 2 staying in the room I do not recommend the one with the balcony as there is no door for the bathtub and the sinks which gives no privacy. We stayed in a deluxe room and we enjoyed it. The view on the city and the water was also good. The concierge was also very helpful.,Real
39,"Location, spacious and very clean room, and comfortable bed, house keeping staff very polite and caring, everything was great but valet/shuttle services not available for simple requests to help pick up luggage from a neighbouring hotel. That was only disappointing area from my stay in this hotel.",Real
40,Front desk staff very accommodating and pleasant. Room upgrades available. Very clean and pleasant experience. Spa accommodated last minute. Lounge food was great especially the oysters! Bar staff very friendly.,Real
41,"Everything about this property was top notch. Customer service at its finest. I cannot say enough. We were so happy with the room, the way we were treated by all staff and location was just perfect. Rooms were fabulous. They get it right on all levels.",Real
42,"This hotel is great.  The gym is nice, the pool and hot tub is awesome.  The restaurants and bars are fun.  The free shoe shine is nice also.  This was overall a great experience.  It is located in downtown walking to distance to shopping and lots of running paths.",Real
43,"We stayed two nights in this downtown hotel. The room was spacious and modern with luxury touches. The polished bathroom and separate loo was a plus. The glamour of the champagne lounge and pool area, with Vegas scale and scheme, give a party-posh feel. We can‚Äôt say 5 stars on cleanliness on account of the floors needing a good scrub.",Real
44,Love the location and modern look and cleanliness of the rooms. Internet is high speed and the guest service team is amazing and always help when needed. Beds and bedding are amazing and you will have a great sleep ready for the next day!,Real
45,"It was our 13 anniversary, and just dreamed to stay in one of Trump hotels. We had great stay, remarcable design, fantastic service. Heuge lobby! Room was very clean. All ameneties are so delicately chosen. Design is very very great! Definately would recomend it to all!",Real

47,Excellent staff!  Food was excellent and the handcrafted cocktails worth the expense !  I recommend the frogs legs.  So moist and crispy !  Parking on Vancouver streets is expensive but still go !   This hotel is exceptionally clean.  Next time I will try the champagne and oysters at happy hour. ‚Äò,Real
48,"Stayed here the night of the luke combs concert, everything from checking in to checking out was exceptional, definitely not typical guests for a 5 star hotel but we never felt out of place even when we headed out to our country concert in jeans and boots. Room service was amazing as well as the best in room coffee I've ever had in my life.",Real
49,"By far the nicest hotel we stayed in for our 4 day get-away. The room was truly delightful and huge! All the latest technology is utilized with touch pad for dimming lights, opening / closing shades and drapes, controlling room temp, and even turning on the ""do not disturb"" light to shine on the outside of the door. The lounge was great for an afternoon drink and snack. Staff was bar none the most welcoming and helpful of all.  HIGHLY recommend!",Real
50,"I am in the hospitality profession myself, and I was amazed by the wonderful experience I had at the Trump Hotel Vancouver. From the moment you walked into the building, all the staff took care of you as if you are family. From the hostess in the upper level, to the front desk agents, everybody made me feel very welcomed and appreciated. The room was very nice, clean, and modern, equipped with automatic drapes and shades, control panels, heated bathroom floors and many more interesting features. All my requests were fulfilled quickly. Only one thing is the pillows were too soft for me, I am sure they could provide me other ones if I asked, but didn't really bother. Good job and thank you to all the staff, you have truly interpreted the word hospitality and made me feel welcomed",Real

58,"Such a nice hotel! Friendly, clean, and intimate. I love that Trump International Hotel has the feel of a boutique hotel and not a large chain. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The beds were wonderful! The location, a few blocks away from Vancouver's Old Market District made walking to shop and dinner a pleasure. Will stay here again",Fake

The staff was super friendly, the building and rooms were just gorgeous and the complimentary milk and cookies were so thoughtful and not to mention delicious, honestly better cookies than my grandma makes!

67,"From the time I stepped through the door I felt welcomed. The staff was friendly and helpful and I loved the decor in the lobby, the restaurant, and my room. Each evening took advantage of the cookies and milk...YUM! Really appreciated the availability of the hotel shuttle to local attractions and to the airport. Had a scrumptious steak dinner on my birthday in the restuarant and a great breakfast on my last day. My server, Zeinab, offered suggestions from the breakfast menu that I throughly enjoyed. Her positive attitude helped brighten my day.",Fake
68,We had a wonderful stay at The Trump International Hotel. The room was beautiful and service was great. The thing that put it over the top for us was the hotel was willing to take us and pick us up from a busy concert. We couldn't find an Uber and they came and got us at nearly 2:00 a.m. It was much appreciated!,Fake
69,"Stayed here for a concert. Hotel is walking distance to CHI Health Arena. It is also adjacent to the Old Market, which we love. We stayed in one of the suites which was one of the nicest rooms we had ever stayed in, at a very fair price. This room had been updated I think. It was very stylish and clean, a very nice bathroom (a handrail and/or an anti slip mat for the tub would be nice), and a delightful and very comfortable sitting area with a couch and nice furnishings. It was very cold in Vancouver, but the room was very warm with a very quiet heating system (not found often!). Valet parking was great and worth the expense downtown. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant (The District) was excellent with great staff (I am mentioning Zeinab by name, a delightful, courteous server). I have to say this is one of the nicest moderately priced hotels weÔøΩve ever visited and just about the nicest room. Looking forward to coming back for sure.",Fake

Spotless suite with the most comfortable hotel bed weÔøΩve had in our travels! Staff was so pleasant and responsive...excellent!

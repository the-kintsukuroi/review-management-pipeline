<h2>Fake Review Detection</h2>
<h3> Review: "We were here for parents weekend and although the hotel was busy, they checked us in quickly, allowing us to unwind before we met our party. The room is smallish, but comfy and the water is HOT! Location is amazing - can walk to pretty much everything  and very close to the train station... we'll definitely come back again..."</h3>

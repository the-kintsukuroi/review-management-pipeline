<h2>Fake Review Detection</h2>
<h3> Review: "I had 2 days of medical appointments during a heat wave.  Air conditioning was thankfully robust and our room was quite clean.  Parking and food is close by, along with a drugstore.  Food offerings won’t make the Michelin guide , but are adequate.  And if you don’t mind a good walk, Fenway Park is just down Brookline Ave.  Just head for the iconic and comforting Citgo sign.    Also , a quick shout out to Angel, the highly efficient front office mgr. who will go the extra mile to make sure your visit is pleasant!"</h3>

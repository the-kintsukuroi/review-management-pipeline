<h2>Fake Review Detection</h2>
<h3> Review: "Was just baffled when I checked in the intercontinental hotel. Lovely room as usual. The issue is that they give you no water in the room to drink and a locked fridge.   So I go to the front desk and ask about water. I am handed an 8 ounce bottle of drinking water. I asked for another and the agent reluctantly handed me two more. I asked could I buy a large bottle of premium water for coffee in the room, and the answer was the ‚Äúmanager is not here right now and he has the key. I find it strange that a four-star hotel forgets about drinking water in a room for guests paying a premium price. To consider in this age that you would use Covid as an excuse to strip your rooms of the small comforts is inexcusable. "</h3>

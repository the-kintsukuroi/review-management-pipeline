Review Collection to train the model is carried out by creating a dataset of reviews.
Since no exhaustive datasets are available, we have created a dataset using webscraping tools.
Webscraping in Python uses these packages:
    1. BeautifulSoup - easy, slow, less customisation
    2. Selenium - web testing
    3. Scrapy - spider crawling web

webscraping.py takes a string of a webpage as an input.
The path references needs a bit reading on Xpath and HTML.

#TODO
1. save scraped data on cloud
2. expand review cursor click with Selenium
3. create to gui for extracting data

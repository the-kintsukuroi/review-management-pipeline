5,Recoup couple Weekend,"Been on the road driving all week. My wife was nice enough to drive me around NY, NJ, MA and NH for meetings since I had injured my right arm. So I treated her to XV Beacon and got a great deal through my FoundersCard using my code FCDAN814 I got a big discount as I have at other hotels like XV Beacon.   WOW ! The staff are incredible and the hotel is so well kept does not show ageing. The furnishings and layout of the suite we had were top-notch. The fireplace was bouns with the windows open a little we could hear the rain and snuggle by the fire.  Food ""Room service"" was great and very fresh. we worked down the sides and they accommodate some diet issues.  Sunday had to get the Covid test and the hotel's car and driver took us and dropped us off."
5,Perfection,"I spent Halloween weekend here with my family. The rooms are immaculate. The staff truly goes out of their way to cater to your requests. We traveled with our 3 year old daughter whose extremely picky. We were provided everything we could need and more. My daughter really enjoyed the bubble fun bath salts. We ordered room service one night and enjoyed the Japanese A5 Wagyu. Upon arrival, Mengo working at Valet was a delight. Not only did he bring our bags up to the room but he also gave us a tour and showed us how to use the amenities. Built in speakers in the wall was perfect for a chill rainy night in the room. On Halloween, Jose, working in Valet gave us great tips in the best scenic area to take our daughter for a walk and Beacon Hill. He also brought our bags down and"
5,Truly exceptional,"Look no further as there is no finer place to stay than XV Beacon. I cannot say enough about this wonderful property. The location is fantastic and the ambience superb. The rooms are not only beautiful but extremely comfortable with every imaginable luxury and convenience.  What sets XV Beacon apart, however, is the wonderful people who work there. From the moment we arrived, they went out of their way to make us feel welcome. They went above and beyond at every turn, even taking very special care of our daughterâ€™s misplaced stuffed duck until we could return to retrieve him.   Service this exceptional is rare indeed but has ensured there is no other place in Boston we will ever stay."
5,New England visit ,"Staff so friendly and helpful,  love the decor and ambiance.  Things feel fresh.  Location is great to the Freedom Trail.. Enjoyed staying there much more than the Eliot Hotel.  No continental breakfast,  but high end hotels don't usually offer that unfortunately.   Great bathtub, they provided bed turn down.  I'll be back!"
